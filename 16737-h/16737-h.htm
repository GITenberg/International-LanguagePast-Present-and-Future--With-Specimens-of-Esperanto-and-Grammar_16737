<p>
   The world is spinning fast down the grooves of change. The old
   disorder changeth. Haply it is yielding place to new. The tongue is a
   little member. It should no longer be allowed to divide the nations.
</p>

<p>
   Two things stand out in the swift change. Science with all its works
   is spreading to all lands. The East, led by Japan, is coming into
   line with the West.
</p>

<p>
   Standardization of life may fittingly be accompanied by
   standardization of language. The effect may be twofold&mdash;Practical
   and Ideal.

   <i>auxiliary</i> is also implied.

<p>
   In dealing with the problem of the introduction of an international
   language, we are met on the threshold by two main questions:
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   1. The question of principle.<br/>
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   2. The question of practice.
</p>

<p>
   By the question of principle is meant, Is it desirable to have a
   universal language? do we wish for one? in short, is there a demand?
</p>

<p>
   The question of practice includes the inquiries, Is such a language
   possible? is it easy? would its introduction be fraught with
   prohibitive difficulties? and the like.
</p>

<p>
   It is clear that, however possible or easy it may be to do a thing,
   there is no case for doing it unless it is wanted; therefore the
   question of principle must be taken first. In the case before us the
   question of principle involves many considerations&mdash;aesthetic,
   political, social, even religious. These will be glanced at in their
   proper place; but for our present purpose they are all subordinate to
   the one great paramount consideration&mdash;the economic one. In the
   world of affairs experience shows that, given a demand of any kind
   whatever, as between an economical method of supplying that demand
   and a non-economical method, in the long run the economical method
   will surely prevail.
</p>

<!-- 011.png -->

<p>
<a name="page002"> </a><span class = "pagenum">2</span>
   If, then, it can be shown that there is a growing need for means of
   international communication, and that a unilingual solution is more
   economical than a multilingual one, there is good ground for thinking
   that the unilingual method of transacting international affairs will
   surely prevail. It then becomes a question of time and method: When
   will men feel the pressure of the demand sufficiently strongly to set
   about supplying it? and what means will they adopt?
</p>

<p>
   The time and the method are by no means indifferent. Though a demand
   (for what is possible) is sure, in the long run, to get itself
   supplied, a long period of wasteful and needless groping may be
   avoided by a clear-sighted and timely realization of the demand, and
   by consequent organized co-operation in supplying it. Intelligent
   anticipation sometimes helps events to occur. It is the object
   of this book to call attention to the present state of affairs,
   and to emphasize the fact that the time is now ripe for dealing
   with the question, and the present moment propitious for solving
   the problem once for all in an orderly way. The merest glance at
   the
   <a href="#languagelist">list of projects for a universal language</a>
   and their dates
   will strengthen the conviction from an historical point of view
   that the fulness of time is accomplished, while the history of
   the rise and fall of <i>Volap&uuml;k</i> and of the extraordinary
   rise of <i>Esperanto</i>, in spite of its precursor's failure, are
   exceedingly significant.
</p>

<p>
   One language has been born, come to maturity, and died of dissension,
   and the world stood by indifferent. Another is now in the first
   full flush of youth and strength. After twenty-nine years of daily
   developing cosmopolitanism&mdash;years that have witnessed the rising
   of a new star in the East and an uninterrupted growth of interchange
   of ideas between the nations of the earth, whether in politics,
   literature, or science, without a single check to the ever-rising
   tide of internationalism&mdash;are we again to let the favourable
   moment pass unused, just for want of making up our minds? At present
   one language holds the field. It is well

<!-- 012.png -->

<a name="page003"> </a><span class = "pagenum">3</span>
   organized; it has abundant enthusiastic partisans accustomed to
   communicate and transact their common business in it, and only too
   anxious to show the way to others. If it be not officially adopted
   and put under the regulation of a duly constituted international
   authority, it may wither away or split into factions as Volap&uuml;k
   did.<sup>1</sup> Or it may continue to grow and flourish, but others of its
   numerous rivals may secure adherents and dispute its claim. This
   would be even worse. It is far harder to rally a multitude of
   conflicting rivals in the same camp, than it is to take over a
   well-organized, homogeneous, and efficient volunteer force, legalize
   its position, and raise it to the status of a regular army. In any
   case, if no concerted action be taken, the question will remain
   in a state of chaos, and the lack of official organization brings
   a great risk of overlapping, dissension, and creation of rival
   interests, and generally produces a state of affairs calculated to
   postpone indefinitely the supply of the demand. Competition that
   neither tends to keep down the price nor to improve the quality of
   the thing produced is mere dissipation of energy.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Esperanto itself is admirably organized (see
   <a href="#partIIchapterVII">Part&nbsp;II., chap.&nbsp;vii.</a>), and there are
   no factions or symptoms of dissension. But Esperantists need official
   support and recognition.
</p>

<p>
   In a word, the one thing needful at present is not a more highly
   perfected language to adopt, but the adoption of the highly perfected
   one we possess. By the admission of experts, no less than by the
   practical experience of great numbers of persons in using it over a
   number of years, it has been found adequate. Once found adequate, its
   absolute utility merely depends upon universal adoption.
</p>

<p>
   With utility in direct proportion to numbers of adherents, every
   recruit augments its value&mdash;a thought which may well encourage
   waverers to make the slight effort necessary to at any rate learn to
   read it.

   II
   <div class="subtitolo">
      the question of principle&mdash;economic advantage of an international language
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   As stated above, the question of principle will be treated here from
   a purely economical point of view, since practical value, measured
   by saving of time, money, and effort, must be the ultimate criterion
   by which the success or failure of so far-reaching a reform as the
   introduction of an international, auxiliary language will be decided.
   The bearing of such a reform upon education, culture, race supremacy,
   etc., is not without importance; but the discussion of these points
   must be postponed as subsidiary.
</p>

<p>
   Reduced to its simplest form, the economical argument is this:
</p>

<p>
   (1) The volume of international intercourse is great and increasing.
</p>

<p>
   (2) This intercourse is at present carried on in many different
   languages of varying degrees of difficulty, but all relatively hard
   of acquisition for those who do not know them as a mother-tongue.
   This is uneconomical.
</p>

<p>
   (3) It is economically sounder to carry on international intercourse
   in one easy language than in a large number of hard ones.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Therefore in principle an easy international language is
   desirable.
</p>

<p>
   Let us glance at these four points a little more in detail.
</p>

<p>
   No. 1 surely needs no demonstration. Every year there is more
   communication between men of different race and language. And it is
   not business, in the narrow sense of the term, that is exclusively or
   even chiefly affected by diversity of language. Besides the enormous
   bulk of pleasure travel, international congresses are growing in
   number and importance; municipal fraternization is the latest
   fashion, and many a worthy alderman,

<!-- 014.png -->

<a name="page005"> </a><span class = "pagenum">5</span>
   touring at the ratepayers' expense, must wish that he had some
   German in Berlin, or a little Italian in Milan. Indeed, it is at
   these points of international contact that language is a real bar,
   actually preventing much intercourse that would otherwise have taken
   place, rather than in business, which is organized in view of the
   difficulty. Then there is the whole realm of scientific and learned
   literature&mdash;work of which the accessibility to all concerned is
   of the first importance, but is often hindered because a translation
   into one language does not pay, or, if made, only reaches a limited
   public. Such bars to freedom of interchange cannot be reckoned in
   money; but modern economics recognizes the personal and social
   factor, and any obstacle to research is certainly a public loss.
</p>

<p>
   But important as are these various spheres of action, an even wider
   international contact of thought and feeling is springing up in our
   days. Democracy, science, and universal education are producing
   everywhere similarity of institutions, of industry, of the whole
   organization of life. Similarity of life will breed community of
   interests, and from this arises real converse&mdash;more give and take
   in the things that matter, less purely superficial dealings of the
   guide-book or conversation-manual type.
</p>

<p>
   (2) "Business," meaning commerce, in so far as it is international,
   may at present be carried on mainly in half a dozen of the principal
   languages of Western Europe. Even so, their multiplicity is
   vexatious. But outside the world of business other languages are
   entering the field, and striving for equal rights. The tendency
   is all towards self-assertion on the part of the nationalities
   that are beginning a new era of national life and importance. The
   language difficulty in the Austrian Empire reflects the growing
   self-consciousness of the Magyars. Everywhere where young peoples
   are pushing their rights to take equal rank among the nations of the
   world, the language question is put in the forefront. The politicians
   of Ireland and Wales have realized the importance of language in
   asserting nationality, but such engineered language-agitation offers
   but

<!-- 015.png -->

<a name="page006"> </a><span class = "pagenum">6</span>
   a feeble reflex of the vitality of the question in lands where the
   native language is as much in use for all purposes as is English in
   England. These lands will fight harder and harder against the claims
   to supremacy of a handful of Western intruders. A famous foreign
   philologist,<sup>1</sup> in a report on the subject presented to the Academy
   of Vienna, notes the increasing tendency of Russian to take rank
   among the recognized languages for purposes of polite learning. He is
   well placed to observe. With Russia knocking at the door and Hungary
   waiting to storm the breach, what tongue may not our descendants
   of the next century have to learn, under pain of losing touch with
   important currents of thought? It is high time something were done
   to standardize means of transmission. Owing to political conditions,
   there are linguistically disintegrating forces at work, which are at
   variance with the integrating forces of natural tendency.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Prof. Shuchardt
</p>

<p>
   From an economical point of view, a considerable amount of time,
   effort, and money must be unreproductively invested in overcoming
   the "language difficulty." In money alone the amount must run into
   thousands of pounds yearly. Among the unreproductive investments
   are&mdash;the employment of foreign correspondence clerks, the time
   and money spent upon the installation of educational plant for
   their production, the time and money spent upon translations and
   interpreters for the proceedings of international conferences and
   negotiations, the time devoted by professors and other researchers
   (often nonlinguists in virtue of their calling) to deciphering
   special treatises and learned periodicals in languages not their
   own.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>These are some of the actual visible losses owing to the
   <i>presence</i> of the language difficulty. No one can estimate
   the value of the losses entailed by the <i>absence</i> of free
   intercourse due to removable linguistic barriers. Potential (but at
   present non-realized) extension of goodwill, swifter progress, and
   wider knowledge represent one side of their value; while consequent
   non-realized increase in volume of actual business represents their
   value in money. The negative statement of absence of results from
   intercourse that never took place affords no measure of positive
   results obtainable under a better system.
</p>

<!-- 016.png -->

<a name="page007"> </a><span class = "pagenum">7</span>

<p>
   The tendency of those engaged in advancing material progress, which
   consists in the subjection of nature to man's ends, is to adapt more
   and more quickly their methods to changing conditions. Has the world
   yet faced in a business-like spirit the problem of wiping out wastage
   on words?
</p>

<p>
   Big industrial concerns scrap machinery while it is yet perfectly
   capable of running and turning out good work, in order to replace
   it by newer machinery, capable of turning out more work in the same
   time. Time is money. Can the busy world afford a language difficulty?
</p>

<p>
   (3) The proposition that it is economically sounder to carry on
   international intercourse in one easy language than in a large number
   of hard ones rests upon the principle that it does not pay to do a
   thing a hard way, if the same results can be produced by an easy way.
</p>

<p>
   The whole industrial revolution brought about by the invention of
   machinery depended upon this principle. Since an artificial language,
   like machinery, is a means invented by man of furthering his ends,
   there seems to be no abuse of analogy in comparing them.
</p>

<p>
   When it was found that machinery would turn out a hundred pieces of
   cloth while the hand-loom turned out one, the hand-loom was doomed,
   except in so far as it may serve other ends, antiquarian, aesthetic,
   or artistic, which are not equally well served by machinery.
   Similarly, to take another revolution which is going on in our own
   day through a further application of machinery, when it is found that
   corn can be reaped and threshed by machinery, that hay can be cut,
   made, carried, and stacked by machinery, that man can travel the
   high road by machinery, sooner or later machinery is bound to get
   the bulk of the job, because it produces the same results at greater
   speed and less cost. So, in the field of international intercourse,
   if an easy artificial language can with equal efficiency and at less
   cost produce the same results as a multiplicity of natural ones, in
   many lines of human activity, and making all reserves in matters
   antiquarian, aesthetic, and

<!-- 017.png -->

<a name="page008"> </a><span class = "pagenum">8</span>
   artistic, sooner or later the multiplicity will have to go to
   the scrap-heap<sup>1</sup> as cumbrous and out of date. It may be a hundred
   years; it may be fifty; it may be even twenty. Almost certainly the
   irresistible trend of economic pressure will work its will and insist
   that what has to be done shall be done in the most economical way.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>But only, of course, in those lines in which an international
   auxiliary language can produce equally good results. This excludes
   home use, national literature, philology, scholarly study of national
   languages, etc.
</p>

<p>
   So much, then, for the question of principle. In treating
   it, certain large assumptions have been made; e.g. it is
   said above, "if an easy artificial language can with equal
   efficiency&nbsp;...&nbsp;produce the same results," etc.
   Here it is assumed that the artificial language is (1) easy, and
   (2) that it is possible for it to produce the same results. Again,
   however easy and possible, its introduction might cost more than it
   saved. These are questions of fact, and are treated in the three
   following chapters under the heading of "The Question of Practice."
</p>

<div class="chapitrotitolo" id="partIchapterIII">
   III
   <div class="subtitolo">
      the question of practice&mdash;an international language is possible
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   The man who says a thing is impossible without troubling to find out
   whether it has been done is merely "talking through his hat," to use
   an Americanism, and we need not waste much time on him. Any one, who
   maintains that it is impossible to transact the ordinary business
   of life and write lucid treatises on scientific and other subjects
   in an artificial language, is simply in the position of the French
   engineer, who gave a full scientific demonstration of the fact that
   an engine could not possibly travel by steam.
</p>

<p>
   The plain fact is that not only one artificial language, but

<!-- 018.png -->

<a name="page009"> </a><span class = "pagenum">9</span>
   several, already exist, which not only can express, but already have
   expressed all the ideas current in social intercourse, business, and
   serious exposition. It is only necessary to state the facts briefly.
</p>

<p>
   First&mdash;<i>Volap&uuml;k.</i>
</p>

<p>
   Three congresses were held in all for the promotion of this language.
   The third (Paris, 1889) was the most important. It was attended
   by Volap&uuml;kists from many different nations, who carried on
   all their business in Volap&uuml;k, and found no difficulty in
   understanding one another. Besides this, there were a great many
   newspapers published in Volap&uuml;k, which treated of all kinds of
   subjects.
</p>

<p>
   Secondly&mdash;<i>Idiom Neutral</i>, the lineal descendant of
   Volap&uuml;k.
</p>

<p>
   It is regulated by an international academy, which sends round
   circulars and does all its business in Idiom Neutral.
</p>

<p>
   Thirdly&mdash;<i>Esperanto</i>.
</p>

<p>
   Since the publication of the language in 1887 it has had a gradually
   increasing number of adherents, who have used it for all ordinary
   purposes of communication. A great number of newspapers and
   reviews of all kinds are now published regularly in Esperanto in
   a great variety of countries. I take up a chance number of the
   <i>Internacia Scienca Revuo</i>, which happens to be on my table,
   and find the following subjects among the contents of the month:
   "<i>R&ocirc;le</i> of living beings in the general physiology of the
   earth," "The carnivorous animals of Sweden," "The part played by
   heredity in the etiology of chronic nephritis," "The migration of
   the lemings," "Notices of books," "Notes and correspondence," etc.
   In fact, the Review has all the appearance of an ordinary scientific
   periodical, and the articles are as clearly expressed and as easy to
   read as those in any similar review in a national language.
</p>

<p>
   Even more convincing perhaps, for the uninitiated, is the evidence
   afforded by the International Congresses of Esperantists. The first
   was held at Boulogne in August 1905. It marked an epoch in the lives
   of many of the participants, whose

<!-- 019.png -->

<a name="page010"> </a><span class = "pagenum">10</span>
   doubts as to the practical nature of an artificial language there,
   for good and all, yielded to the logic of facts; and it may well
   be that it will some day be rather an outstanding landmark in the
   history of civilization. A brief description will, therefore, not be
   out of place.
</p>

<p>
   In the little seaport town on the north coast of France had come
   together men and women of more than twenty different races. Some
   were experts, some were beginners; but all save a very few must have
   been alike in this, that they had learnt their Esperanto at home,
   and, as far as oral use went, had only been able to speak it (if at
   all) with members of their own national groups&mdash;that is, with
   compatriots who had acquired the language under the same conditions
   as to pronunciation, etc., as themselves. Experts and beginners,
   those who from practical experience knew the great possibilities
   of the new tongue as a written medium, no less than the neophytes
   and tentative experimenters who had come to see whether the thing
   was worth taking seriously, they were now to make the decisive
   trial&mdash;in the one case to test the faith that was in them, in the
   other to set all doubt at rest in one sense or the other for good and
   all.
</p>

<p>
   The town theatre had been generously placed at the disposal of the
   Congress, and the author of the language, Dr. Zamenhof, had left his
   eye-patients at Warsaw and come to preside at the coming out of his
   <i>kara lingvo</i>, now well on in her 'teens, and about to leave
   the academic seclusion of scholastic use and emerge into the larger
   sphere of social and practical activity.
</p>

<p>
   On Saturday evening, August 5, at eight o'clock, the Boulogne Theatre
   was packed with a cosmopolitan audience. The unique assembly was
   pervaded by an indefinable feeling of expectancy; as in the lull
   before the thunderstorm, there was the hush of excitement, the tense
   silence charged with the premonition of some vast force about to be
   let loose on the world. After a few preliminaries, there was a really
   dramatic moment when Dr. Zamenhof stood up for the first time to
   address his world-audience in the world-tongue. Would they understand
   him?

<!-- 020.png -->

<a name="page011"> </a><span class = "pagenum">11</span>
   Was their hope about to be justified? or was it all a chimera, "such
   stuff as dreams are made on"?
</p>

<p>
   "<i>Gesinjoroj</i>" (= Ladies and gentlemen)&mdash;the great
   audience craned forward like one man, straining eyes and ears
   towards the speaker,&mdash;"<i>Kun granda plezuro mi akceptis la
   proponon</i>..." The crowd drank in the words with
   an almost pathetic agony of anxiety. Gradually, as the clear-cut
   sentences poured forth in a continuous stream of perfect lucidity,
   and the audience realized that they were all listening to and all
   understanding a really international speech in a really international
   tongue&mdash;a tongue which secured to them, as here in Boulogne so
   throughout the world, full comprehension and a sense of comradeship
   and fellow-citizenship on equal terms with all users of it&mdash;the
   anxiety gave way to a scene of wild enthusiasm. Men shook hands
   with perfect strangers, and all cheered and cheered again. Zamenhof
   finished with a solemn declamation of one of his hymns (given as an
   appendix to this volume, with translation), embodying the lofty ideal
   which has inspired him all through and sustained him through the many
   difficulties he has had to face. When he came to the end, the fine
   passage beginning with the words, "<i>Ni inter popoloj la murojn
   detruos</i>" ("we shall throw down the walls between the peoples"),
   and ending "<i>amo kaj vero ekregos sur tero</i>" ("love and truth
   shall begin their reign on earth"), the whole concourse rose to their
   feet with prolonged cries of "Vivu Zamenhof!"
</p>

<p>
   No doubt this enthusiasm may sound rather forced and unreal to those
   who have not attended a congress, and the cheers may ring hollow
   across intervening time and space. Neither would it be good for this
   or any movement to rely upon facile enthusiasm, as easily damped as
   aroused. There is something far more than this in the international
   language movement.
</p>

<p>
   At the same time, it is impossible for any one who has not tried it
   to realize the thrill&mdash;not a weak, sentimental thrill, but a
   reasonable thrill, starting from objective fact and running down the
   marrow of things&mdash;given by the first real contact with an

<!-- 021.png -->

<a name="page012"> </a><span class = "pagenum">12</span>
   international language in an international setting. There really is a
   feeling as of a new power born into the world.
</p>

<p>
   Those who were present at the Geneva Congress, 1906, will not soon
   forget the singing of the song "La Espero" at the solemn closing
   of the week's proceedings. The organ rolled out the melody, and
   when the gathered thousands that thronged the floor of the hall and
   packed the galleries tier on tier to the ceiling took up the opening
   phrase&mdash;

      </tr>
   </table>

<p>
   they meant every word of it. It was a fitting summary of the
   impressions left by the events of the week, and what the lips uttered
   must have been in the hearts and minds of all.

<p>
   As an ounce of personal experience is worth a pound of second-hand
   recital, a brief statement may here be given of the way in which the
   present writer came to take up Esperanto, and of the experiences
   which soon led him to the conviction of its absolute practicability
   and utility.
</p>

<p>
   In October, 1905, having just returned from an absence of some years
   in Canada and the Far East, he had his attention turned to Esperanto
   for the first time by reading an account of the Congress of Boulogne.
   He had no previous knowledge of, or leanings towards, a universal
   language; and if he had thought about it at all, it was only to laugh
   at the idea as a wild and visionary scheme. In short, his attitude
   was quite normal.
</p>

<p>
   But here was a definite statement, professing to be one of positive
   accomplished fact. One of two things: either the newspaper account
   was not true; or else, the facts being as represented, here was a
   new possibility to be reckoned with. The only course was to send for
   the books and test the thing on its merits. Being somewhat used to
   languages, he did not take long to see that this one was good enough
   in itself. A letter, written in

<!-- 022.png -->

<a name="page013"> </a><span class = "pagenum">13</span>
   Esperanto, after a few days' study of the grammar at odd times, with
   a halfpenny Esperanto-English key enclosed, was fully understood
   by the addressee, though he was ignorant up till then of the very
   existence of Esperanto. This experience has often been since
   repeated; indeed, the correspondent will often write back after a few
   days in Esperanto. Such letters have always been found intelligible,
   though in no case did the correspondent know Esperanto previously.
   The experiment is instructive and amusing, and can be tried by any
   one for an expenditure of twopence for keys and a few hours for
   studying the sixteen rules and their application. To many minds these
   are far simpler and more easy to grasp for practical use than the
   rules for scoring at bridge.
</p>

<p>
   After a month or two's playing with the language in spare time,
   the writer further tested it, by sending out a flight of postcards
   to various selected Esperantists' addresses in different parts of
   the Russian Empire. The addressees ranged from St. Petersburg and
   Helsingfors through Poland to the Caucasus and to far Siberia. In
   nearly every case answers were received, and in some instances the
   initial interchange of postcards led to an extremely interesting
   correspondence, throwing much light on the disturbed state of
   things in the native town or province of the correspondent. From
   a Tiflis doctor came a graphic account of the state of affairs in
   the Caucasus; while a school inspector from the depths of Eastern
   Siberia painted a vivid picture of the effect of political unrest
   on the schools&mdash;lockouts and "malodorous chemical obstructions"
   (<i>Anglice</i>&mdash;the schools were stunk out). Many writers
   expressed themselves with great freedom, but feared their letters
   would not pass the censor. Judging by the proportion of answers
   received, the censorship was not at that time efficient. In no case
   was there any difficulty in grasping the writer's meaning. All the
   answers were in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   This was fairly convincing, but still having doubts on the question
   of pronunciation, the writer resolved to attend the Esperanto
   Congress to be held at Geneva in August 1906. To

<!-- 023.png -->

<a name="page014"> </a><span class = "pagenum">14</span>
   this end he continued to read Esperanto at odd minutes and took in
   an Esperanto gazette. About three weeks before the congress he got
   a member of his family to read aloud to him every day as far as
   possible a page or two of Esperanto, in order to attune his ear.
   He never had an opportunity of speaking the language before the
   congress, except once for a few minutes, when he travelled some
   distance to attend a meeting of the nearest English group.
</p>

<p>
   Thus equipped, he went through the Congress of Geneva, and found
   himself able to follow most of the proceedings, and to converse
   freely, though slowly, with people of the most diverse nationality.
   At an early sitting of the congress he found himself next to a
   Russian from Kischineff, who had been through the first great
   <i>pogrom</i>, and a most interesting conversation ensued. Another
   day the neighbours were an Indian nawab and an abb&eacute; from
   Madrid. Another time it was a Bulgarian. At the first official
   banquet he sat next to a Finn, who rejoiced in the name of Attila,
   and, but for the civilizing influence of a universal language, might
   have been in the sunny south, like his namesake of the ancient world,
   on a very different errand from his present peaceful one. Yet here he
   was, rubbing elbows with Italians, as if there had never been such
   things as Huns or a sack of Rome by northern barbarians.
</p>

<p>
   During the meal a Frenchman, finding himself near us English and
   some Germans, proposed a toast to the "entente cordiale taking in
   Germany," which was honoured with great enthusiasm. This is merely an
   instance of the small ways in which such gatherings make for peace
   and good will.
</p>

<p>
   With all these people it was perfectly easy to converse in the common
   tongue, pronunciation and national idiom being no bar in practice.
</p>

<p>
   And this experience was general throughout the duration of the
   congress. Day by day sittings were held for the transaction of all
   kinds of business and the discussion of the most varied subjects. It
   was impressive to see people from half the countries of the

<!-- 024.png -->

<a name="page015"> </a><span class = "pagenum">15</span>
   world rise from different corners of the hall and contribute their
   share to the discussion in the most matter-of-fact way. Day by
   day the congressists met in social functions, debates, lectures,
   and sectional groups (chemical, medical, legal, etc.) for the
   regulation of matters touching their special interests. Everything
   was done in Esperanto, and never was there the slightest hitch
   or misunderstanding, or failure to give adequate expression to
   opinions owing to defects of language. The language difficulty was
   annihilated.
</p>

<p>
   Perhaps one of the most striking demonstrations of this return to
   pre-Babel conditions was the performance of a three-part
   comedy by a Frenchman, a Russian, and a Spaniard. Such a thing would
   inevitably have been grotesque in any national language; but here
   they met on common neutral ground. No one's accent was "foreign,"
   and none of the spectators possessed that mother-tongue
   acquaintance with Esperanto that would lead them to feel slight
   divergences shocking, or even noticeable without extreme attention
   to the point. Other theatrical performances were given at Geneva, as
   also at Boulogne, where a play of Moli&egrave;re was performed in
   Esperanto by actors of eight nationalities with one rehearsal, and
   with full success.
</p>

<p>
   In the face of these facts it is idle to oppose a universal
   artificial language on the score of impossibility or inadequacy. The
   theoretical pronunciation difficulty completely crumbled away before
   the test of practice.
</p>

<p>
   The "war-at-any-price party," the
   whole-hoggers <i>&agrave; tous crins</i> (the juxtaposition of
   the two national idioms lends a certain realism, and heightens the
   effect of each), are therefore driven back on their second line of
   attack, if the Hibernianism may be excused. "Yes," they say, "your
   language may be possible, but, after all, why not learn an existing
   language, if you've got to learn one anyway?"
</p>

<p>
   Now, quite apart from the obvious fact that the nations will never
   agree to give the preference to the language of one of them to the
   prejudice of the others, this argument involves the

<!-- 025.png -->

<a name="page016"> </a><span class = "pagenum">16</span>
   suggestion that an artificial language is no easier to learn than a
   natural one. We thus come to the question of ease as a qualification.

</p>

<p>
   People smile incredulously at the mention of an artificial language,
   implying that no easy royal road can be found to language-learning
   of any kind. But the odds are all the other way, and they are heavy
   odds.
</p>

<p>
   The reason for this is quite simple, and may be briefly put as
   follows:
</p>

<p>
   The object of language is to express thought and feeling.
   Every natural language contains all kinds of complications and
   irregularities, which are of no use whatever in attaining this
   object, but merely exist because they happen to have grown. Their
   sole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> is historical. In fact, for a
   language without a history they are <i>unnecessary</i><sup>1</sup>. Therefore
   a universal language, whose only object is to supply to every one
   the simplest possible means of expressing his thoughts and feelings
   in a medium intelligible to every one else, simply leaves them out.
   Now, it is precisely in these "unnecessary" complications that a
   large proportion&mdash;certainly more than half&mdash;of the difficulty
   of learning a foreign language consists. Therefore an artificial
   language, by merely leaving them out, becomes certainly more than
   twice as easy to learn as any natural language.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>i.e. they do not assist in attaining its object as a language.
   One universal way of forming the plural, past tense, or comparative
   expresses plurality, past time, or comparison just as well as fifteen
   ways, and with a deal less trouble.
</p>

<!-- 026.png -->

<a name="page017"> </a><span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<p>
   A little reflection will make this truth so absurdly obvious, that
   the only wonder is, not that it is now beginning to be recognized,
   but that any one could have ever derided it.
</p>

<p>
   That the "unnecessary" difficulties of a natural language are more
   than one-half of the whole is certainly an under-estimate; for some
   languages the proportion would be more like 3:4 or 5:6. Compared with
   these, the artificial language would be three times to five times as
   easy.
</p>

<p>
   Take an illustration. Compare the work to be done by the learner of
   (<i>a</i>) Latin, (<i>b</i>) Esperanto, in expressing past, present,
   and future action.

<a name="page018"> </a><span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<p>
   (<i>b</i>) Esperanto: No new endings at all. Merely the three-form
   regular active conjugation of the verb <i>esti</i>&nbsp;= to be, with a
   passive participle. No confusion possible.
</p>

<p>
   It is just the same with compound tenses, subjunctives, participles,
   etc. Making all due allowances, it is quite safe to say that the
   Latin verb is fifty times as hard as the Esperanto verb.
</p>

<p>
   The proportion would be about the same in the case of substantives,
   Latin having innumerable types.
</p>

<p>
   Comparing modern languages with Esperanto, the proportion in favour
   of the latter would not be so high as fifty to one in the inflection
   of verbs and nouns, though even here it would be very great, allowing
   for subjunctives, auxiliaries, irregularities, etc. But taking the
   whole languages, it might well rise to ten to one.
</p>

<p>
   For what are the chief difficulties in language-learning?
</p>

<p>
   They are mainly either difficulties of phonetics, or of structure and
   vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
   Difficulties of phonetics are:
</p>

<p>
   (1) Multiplicity of sounds to be produced, including many sounds and
   combinations that do not occur in the language of the learner.
</p>

<p>
   (2) Variation of accent, and of sounds expressed by the same letter.
</p>

<p>
   These difficulties are both eliminated in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   (1) Relatively few sounds are adopted into the language, and only
   such as are common to nearly all languages. For instance, there are
   only five full vowels and three<sup>1</sup> diphthongs, which can be explained
   to every speaker in terms of his own language. All the modified
   vowels, closed "u's" and "e's," half tones, longs and shorts, open
   and closed vowels, etc., which form the chief bugbear in correct
   pronunciation, and often render the foreigner unintelligible&mdash;all
   these disappear.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Omitting the rare <i>e&#365;</i>. <i>ej</i> and <i>uj</i> are
   merely simple vowels plus consonantal <i>j</i> (= English <i>y</i>).
</p>

<p>
   (2) There is no variation of accent or of sound expressed by

<!-- 028.png -->

<a name="page019"> </a><span class = "pagenum">19</span>
   the same letter. The principle "one letter, one sound"<sup>1</sup> is adhered to
   absolutely. Thus, having learned one simple rule for accent (always
   on the last syllable but one), and the uniform sound corresponding to
   each letter, no mistake is possible.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>The converse&mdash;"one sound, one letter"&mdash;is also true,
   except that the same sound is expressed by <i>c</i> and <i>ts</i>.
   (See <a href="#appendixC">Appendix&nbsp;C</a>.)
</p>

<p>
   Contrast this with English. Miss Soames gives twenty-one ways of
   writing the same sound. Here they are:

</p>

<p>
   (Compare eye, lie, high, etc.)
</p>

<p>
   In Esperanto this sound is expressed only and always by "e." In
   fact, the language is absolutely and entirely phonetic, as all real
   language was once.
</p>

<p>
   As regards difficulties of vocabulary, the same may be said as in
   the case of the sounds. Esperanto only adopts the minimum of roots
   essential, and these are simple, non-ambiguous, and as international
   as possible. Owing to the device of word-building by means of a
   few suffixes and prefixes with fixed meaning, the number of roots
   necessary is very greatly less than in any natural language.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Most of these roots are already known to educated people. For the
   young the learning of a certain number of words presents practically
   no difficulty; it is in the practical application of words learnt
   that they break down, and this failure is almost entirely due to
   "unnecessary" difficulties.
</p>

<p>
   As for difficulties of structure, some of the chief ones are as
   follows:
</p>

<p>
   <i>Multiplicity and complexity of inflections.</i> This does not
   exist in Esperanto.
</p>

<!-- 029.png -->

<a name="page020"> </a><span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<p>
   <i>Irregularities and exceptions of all kinds.</i> None in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   <i>Complications of orthography.</i> None in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   <i>Different senses of same word, and different words used in same
   sense.</i> Esperanto&mdash;"one word, one meaning."
</p>

<p>
   <i>Arbitrary and fluctuating idioms.</i> Esperanto&mdash;none. Common
   sense and common grammar the only limitation to combination of words.
</p>

<p>
   <i>Complexities of syntax.</i> (Think of the use of the subjunctive
   and infinitive in all languages: <i>&omicron;&upsilon;</i> and
   <i>&mu;&eta;</i> in Greek; indirect speech in Latin; negatives,
   comparisons, etc., etc., in all languages.) Esperanto&mdash;none.
   Common sense the only guide, and no ambiguity in practice. The
   perfect limpidity of Esperanto, with no syntactical rules, is a most
   instructive proof of the conventionality and arbitrariness of the
   niceties of syntax in national languages. After all, the subjunctive
   was made for man and not man for the subjunctive.
</p>

<p id="concreteproofs">
   But readers will say: "It is all very well to show by a comparison of
   forms that Esperanto <i>ought</i> to be much easier than a natural
   language. But we want facts."
</p>

<p>
   Here are some.
</p>

<p>
   In the last chapter it was mentioned that the present writer first
   took up Esperanto in October 1905, worked at it at odd times, never
   spoke it or heard it spoken save once, and was able to follow the
   proceedings of the Congress of Geneva in August 1906, and talk to all
   foreigners. From a long experience of smattering in many languages
   and learning a few thoroughly, he is absolutely convinced that this
   would have been impossible to him in any national language.
</p>

<p>
   A lady who began Esperanto three weeks before the congress, and
   studied it in a grammar by herself one hour each day, was able to
   talk in it with all peoples on very simple subjects, and to follow a
   considerable amount of the lectures, etc.
</p>

<p>
   Amongst the British folk who attended the congress were many clerks
   and commercial people, who had merely learnt Esperanto by attending a
   class or a local group meeting once a week, often

<!-- 030.png -->

<a name="page021"> </a><span class = "pagenum">21</span>
   for not many months. They had never been out of England before, nor
   learnt any other foreign language. They would have been utterly
   at sea if they had attempted to do what they did on a similar
   acquaintance with any foreign tongue. But during the two days spent
   <i>en route</i> in Paris, where the British party was f&ecirc;ted
   and shown round by the French Esperantists, on the journey to
   Geneva, which English and French made together, on lake steamboats,
   at picnics and dinners, etc., etc., here they were, rattling away
   with great ease and mutual entertainment. Many of these came from
   the North of England, and it was a real eye-opener, over
   which easy-going South-Englanders would do well to
   ponder, to see what results could be produced by a little energy
   and application, building on no previous linguistic training.
   The Northern accent was evidently a help in pronouncing the
   full-sounding vowels of Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   One Englishman, who was talking away gaily with the French
   <i>samideanoj</i>,<sup>1</sup> was an Esperantist of one year's
   standing. He had happened to be at Boulogne in pursuit of a little
   combined French and seasiding at the time of the first congress
   held there, 1905. One day he got his tongue badly tied up in a
   cafe, and was helped out of his linguistic difficulties with the
   waiter by certain compatriots, who wore green stars in their
   buttonholes,<sup>2</sup> and sat at another table conversing in an
   unknown lingo with a crowd of foreigners. He made inquiries, and
   found it was Esperanto they were talking. He was so much struck by
   their facility, and the practical way in which they had set his
   business to rights in a minute (the waiter was an Esperantist trained
   <i>ad hoc</i>!), that he decided to give up French and go in for
   Esperanto. This man was a real learner of French, who had spent a
   long time on it, and realized with disgust his impotence to wield it
   practically. To judge by his conversation next year at Geneva, he had
   no such difficulty with Esperanto. He was quite jubilant over the
   change.

<p>
   Scientific comparison of the respective difficulty of Esperanto and
   other languages, based on properly collected and tabulated results,
   does not seem to be yet obtainable. It is difficult to get high-class
   schools, where language-teaching is a regular and important part of
   the curriculum, to give an artificial language a fair trial. Properly
   organized and carried-out tests are greatly to be desired. If and
   when they are made, it will probably be found that Esperanto is not
   only very easy of acquisition itself, but that it has a beneficial
   effect upon other language-learning.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>See <a href="#partIIIchapterII">Part&nbsp;III., chap.&nbsp;ii</a>.
</p>

<p>
   Meantime, the present writer has carried out one small experiment
   in a good secondary school for girls, where French and German
   are regularly spoken and taught for many hours in the week. The
   head-mistress introduced Esperanto as a regular school subject at
   the beginning of the Easter term, January 1907. At the end of term a
   test paper was set, consisting of English sentences to be rendered
   into French and Esperanto without any dictionary or other aid, and
   one short passage of English prose to be rendered into both languages
   with any aid from books that the pupils wished. The object was to
   determine how far a few hours' teaching of Esperanto would produce
   results comparable with those obtained in a language learnt for
   years.
</p>

<p>
   The examinees ranged from fourteen to sixteen years. They had been
   learning French from two to seven years, and had a daily French
   lesson, besides speaking French on alternate days in the school. They
   had learnt Esperanto for ten weeks, from one to one and a half hours
   per week. <i>Taking the papers all through, the Esperanto results
   were nearly as good as the French.</i>
</p>

<p>
   One last experiment may be mentioned. It was made under scientific
   conditions on September 23, 1905. The subject was an adult, who
   had learnt French and German for years at school, and had since
   taught French to young boys, but was not a linguist by training or
   education, having read mathematics at the university.

<p>
   He had had no lessons in Esperanto, and had never studied the
   language, his sole knowledge of it being derived from general
   conversation with an enthusiast, who had just returned from the
   Geneva Congress. He was disposed to laugh at Esperanto, but was
   persuaded to test its possibilities as a language that can be written
   intelligibly by an educated person merely from dictionary by a few
   rules.
</p>

<p>
   He was given a page of carefully prepared English to translate into
   Esperanto. The following written aids were given:
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   1. Twenty-five crude roots (e.g. <i>lern-</i> = to learn.)
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   2. One suffix, with explanation of its use.
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   3. A one-page complete grammar of the Esperanto language.
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   4. An Esperanto-English and an English-Esperanto dictionary.
</p>

<p>
   He produced a good page of perfectly intelligible Esperanto, quite
   free from serious grammatical mistake. He admitted that he could not
   translate the passage so well into French or German.
</p>

<p>
   Such experiments go a good way towards proving the case for an
   artificial language. More are urgently needed, especially of the last
   two types. They serve to convince all those who come within range of
   the experiment that an artificial language is a serious project, and
   may confer great benefits at small cost. Any one can make them with a
   little trouble, if he can secure a victim. A particularly interesting
   one is to send a letter in Esperanto to some English or foreign
   correspondent, enclosing a penny key. The letter will certainly be
   understood, and very likely the answer will be in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   Doubters as to the ease and efficacy of a universal language are not
   asked to believe without trial. They are merely asked not to condemn
   or be unfavourable until they have a right to an opinion on the
   subject. And they are asked to <i>form</i> an opinion by personally
   testing, or at any rate by weighing actual facts. "A fair field and
   no favour."
</p>

<p>
   The very best way of testing the thing is to study the language for a
   few hours and attend a congress. The next congress is to be held in
   Cambridge, England, in August 1907.

      introduction of<br/>an international language would not cause
      dislocation
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   In Chapters II., III., and IV. it was sought to prove that a
   universal language is desirable in principle, that it already exists
   and is efficient, and that it is very easy. If these propositions are
   true, the only valid argument against introducing it at once would
   be a demonstration that its introduction is either impracticable or
   else attended with such disadvantages as to outweigh the beneficial
   results.
</p>

<p>
   Now, it is quite true that certain schemes tending towards
   international uniformity of practice and, therefore, ultimately
   productive of saving of labour are nevertheless such that their
   realization would cause an almost prohibitive dislocation of present
   organization. A conspicuous example is the proposed adoption of the
   decimal system in coinage and weights and measures. So great is the
   loss of time and trouble (and therefore of money) entailed by using
   an antiquated and cumbrous-system instead of a simple and modern one
   that does the work as well, that the big firm Kynochs some months ago
   introduced the decimal system, in spite of the enormous difficulty
   of having to keep a double method going. But hitherto, at any rate,
   the great disturbance to business that the change would cause has
   prevented it from being generally made. Both this matter and the
   curiously out-of-date<sup>1</sup> system of spelling modern English present a
   fairly

<!-- 034.png -->

<a name="page025"> </a><span class = "pagenum">25</span>
   close analogy to the multilingual system of international
   intercourse, as regards unprofitable expenditure of time and trouble.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Out of date, because it has failed to keep pace with the change of
   pronunciation. Spelling, i.e. use of writing, was merely a device for
   representing to the eye the spoken sounds, so that failure to do this
   means getting out of date.
</p>

<p>
   But where the analogy breaks down altogether is in the matter of
   obstacles to reform.
</p>

<p>
   Supposing that all the ministries of education in the world issued
   orders, that as from January 1, 1909, an auxiliary language should
   be taught in every government school; supposing that merchants took
   to doing foreign business wholesale in an auxiliary language, or
   that men of science took to issuing all their books and treatises
   in it; whose business would be dislocated? What literature or books
   would become obsolete? Who, except foreign correspondence clerks and
   interpreters, would be a penny the worse? Surely a useful reform
   need not be delayed or refused in the interests of interpreters and
   correspondence clerks. Even these would only be eliminated gradually
   as the reform spread. There would be absolutely no general confusion
   analogous to that following on a sudden change to phonetic spelling
   or the metric system, because nothing would be displaced.
</p>

<p>
   Look at the precedents&mdash;the adoption of an international
   maritime code, and of an international system of cataloguing which
   puts bibliography on an equal footing all over the world by means of
   a common system of classification. Did any confusion or dislocation
   follow on these reforms? Quite the contrary. It was enough for
   England and France to agree on the use of the maritime code, and
   the rest of the nations had to come into line. It would be the same
   with the official recognition by a group of powerful nations of an
   auxiliary language. As soon as the world recognizes that it is a
   labour-saving device on a large scale, and a matter of public
   convenience on the same plane as codes, telegraphy, or shorthand,
   it will no doubt be introduced. But why wait until there are rival
   schemes with large followings and vested interests&mdash;in short,
   until the same obstacles arise to the choice of an international,
   artificial, and neutral language, as now prevent the elevation
   of any national language into a universal medium? The plea of
   impracticability on the score of dislocation

   might then be valid. At present it is not. To have an easy language
   that will carry you anywhere and enable you to read anything, it
   is sufficient to wish for it. Only, as we Britons are being taught
   to "think imperially," so must the nations learn in this matter to
   <i>wish internationally</i>.

      international action already taken for the introduction of an
      auxiliary language
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   The main work of educating the public to "wish internationally,"
   the necessary precedent to official action, has naturally in the
   past been done by the adherents of the various language-schemes
   themselves. An outline of the most important of these movements is
   given in the second part of this book.
</p>

<p>
   But apart from these there is now an international organization that
   is working for the adoption of an international auxiliary language,
   and a brief account of it may be given here.
</p>

<p>
   During the Paris Exhibition of 1900 a number of international
   congresses and learned societies, which were holding meetings there,
   appointed delegates for the consideration of the international
   language question. These delegates met on January 17, 1901, and
   founded a "Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary
   Language." They drew up the following declaration, which has been
   approved by all subsequently elected delegates:
</p>

<hr width="62%" align="center"/>

<div class="majusklete" style="text-align: center">
   Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language
</div>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center">Declaration</p>

<p>
   The undersigned, deputed by various Congresses and Societies to study
   the question of an international auxiliary language, have agreed on
   the following points:
</p>

<!-- 036.png -->

<a name="page027"> </a><span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<p>
   (1) There is a necessity to choose and to spread the use of an
   international language, designed not to replace national idioms in
   the individual life of each people, but to serve in the written and
   oral relations between persons whose mother-tongues are different.
</p>

<p>
   (2) In order to fulfil its purpose usefully, an international
   language must satisfy the following conditions:
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   1st Condition: It must fulfil the needs of the ordinary intercourse
   of social life, of commercial communications, and of scientific and
   philosophic relations;
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   2nd Condition: It must be easily acquired by every person of
   average elementary education, and especially by persons of European
   civilization;
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   3rd Condition: It must not be one of the national languages.
</p>

<p>
   (3) It is desirable to organize a general
   <span class="majusklete">Delegation</span>
   representing all who realize the necessity, as well as the
   possibility, of an international auxiliary language, and who are
   interested in its employment. This Delegation will appoint a
   Committee of members who can meet during a certain period of time.
   The purpose of this Committee is defined in the following articles.
</p>

<p>
   (4) The choice of the auxiliary language belongs in the first
   instance to the <i>International Association of Academies</i>, or, in
   case of failure, to the Committee mentioned in Art. 3.
</p>

<p>
   (5) Consequently the first duty of the Committee will be to present
   to the <i>International Association of Academies</i>, in the required
   forms, the desires expressed by the constituent Societies and
   Congresses, and to invite it respectfully to realize the project of
   an auxiliary language.
</p>

<p>
   (6) It will be the duty of the Committee to create a Society for
   propaganda, to spread the use of the auxiliary language which is
   chosen.
</p>

<p>
   (7) The undersigned, being delegated by various Congresses and
   Societies, decide to approach all learned bodies, and all societies
   of business men and tourists, in order to obtain their adhesion to
   the present project.
</p>

<p>
   (8) Representatives of regularly constituted Societies which have
   agreed to the present <i>Declaration</i> will be admitted as members
   of the <span class="majusklete">Delegation</span>.
</p>

<hr width="62%" align="center"/>

<p>
   This declaration is the official programme of the Delegation. The
   most important point of principle to note is Art. 2, 3rd Con.: "It
   must not be one of the national languages."
</p>

<p>
   As regards the methods of action prescribed, no attempt is to be
   made to bring direct pressure to bear upon any government. It was
   rightly felt that the adoption of a universal language is a matter
   for private initiative. No government can properly take up the
   question, no Ministry of Education can officially introduce an
   auxiliary language into the schools under its control, until the
   principle has met with a certain amount of general recognition.
   The result of a direct appeal to any government or governments
   could only have been, in the most favourable case, the appointment
   by the government appealed to of a commission to investigate and
   report on the question. Such a commission would examine experts and
   witnesses from representative bodies, such as academies, institutes,
   philological and other learned societies. The best course of action,
   therefore, for the promoters of an international language is to apply
   direct to such bodies, to bring the question before them and try to
   gain their support. This is what the Delegation has done.
</p>

<p>
   Now, there already exists an international organization whose object
   is to represent and focus the opinion of learned societies in all
   countries. This is the International Association of Academies,
   formed in 1900 for the express purpose, according to its statutes,
   of promoting "scientific enterprises of international interest." The
   delegates feel that the adoption of an international language comes
   in the fullest sense within the letter and spirit of this statute. It
   is, therefore, to this Association that the choice of language is, in
   the first place, left. (Art. 4.)
</p>

<p>
   The Association meets triennially. At its first meeting (Paris 1901)
   the question of international language was brought before

<!-- 038.png -->

<a name="page029"> </a><span class = "pagenum">29</span>
   it by General S&eacute;bert, of the French Institute, but too late
   to be included among the agenda of that meeting. The occasion was
   important as eliciting an expression of opinion on the part of the
   signatories to General S&eacute;bert's address. These included
   twenty-five members of the French Institute, one of the most
   distinguished scientific bodies in the world.
</p>

<p>
   At the second meeting of the Association (London 1904) the Delegation
   did not officially present the question for discussion, but the
   following paragraph appears in the report of the proceedings of the
   Royal Society, which was the host (<i>London Royal Society</i>, 1904,
   C. Section of Letters, Thursday, May 26, 1904, p. 33):
</p>

<p>
   "In the course of the sitting, the chairman (Lord Reay, President of
   the British Academy) submitted to the meeting whether the question
   of the 'International Auxiliary Language' should be considered,
   though not included in the agenda. From many quarters applications
   had been made that the subject might be discussed in some form or
   other. Prof. Goldziher and M. Perrot spoke against the suggested
   discussion, the former maintaining that the matter was a general
   question of international communication, and did not specifically
   affect scientific interests; the latter announced that he had been
   commissioned by the <i>Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions</i> to oppose
   the consideration of this subject. The matter then dropped."
</p>

<p>
   The third meeting of the Association of Academies was held at Vienna
   at the end of May 1907, under the auspices of the Vienna Academy
   of Science. The question was officially laid before it by the
   Delegation. The Association declared, for formal reasons, that the
   question did not fall within its competence.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>In the voting as to the inclusion of the question in the agenda,
   eight votes were cast in favour of international language, and twelve
   against. This considerable minority shows very encouraging progress
   in such a body, considering the newness of the scheme.
</p>

<p>
   Up till now only two national academies have shown themselves
   favourable to the scheme, those of Vienna and Copenhagen.
</p>

<!-- 039.png -->

<a name="page030"> </a><span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<p>
   The Vienna Academy commissioned one of its most eminent members,
   Prof. Schuchardt, to watch the movement on its behalf, and to keep
   it informed on the subject. In 1904 he presented a report favourable
   to an international language. He and Prof. Jespersen are amongst the
   most famous philologists who support the movement.
</p>

<p>
   It is not therefore anticipated that the Association of Academies
   will take up the question; and the Delegation, thinking it desirable
   not to wait indefinitely till it is converted, has proceeded to the
   election of a committee, as provided in Art. 4 of the Declaration.
   It consists of twelve members, with powers to add to their number.
   It will meet in Paris, October 5, 1907. It is anticipated that the
   language chosen will be Esperanto. None of the members of this
   international committee are English, all the English savants invited
   having declined.
</p>

<p>
   What may be the practical effect of the choice made by this Committee
   remains to be seen. In France there is a permanent Parliamentary
   Commission for the consideration of questions affecting public
   education. This Commission has for some time had before it a proposal
   for the introduction of Esperanto into the State schools of France,
   signed by twelve members of Parliament and referred by the House to
   the Commission. This year the proposal has been presented again in a
   different form. The text of the scheme, which is much more practical
   than the former one, is as follows:
</p>

<p>
   "The study of the international language Esperanto will be included
   in the curricula of those government schools in which modern
   languages are already taught.
</p>

<p>
   "This study will be optional, and candidates who offer for the
   various examinations English, German, Italian, Spanish, or Arabic,
   will be allowed to offer Esperanto as an additional subject.
</p>

<p>
   "They will be entitled to the advantages enjoyed by candidates who
   offer an additional language."
</p>

<p>
   At present it is a very usual thing to offer an additional language,
   and if this project passes, Esperanto will be on

<!-- 040.png -->

<a name="page031"> </a><span class = "pagenum">31</span>
   exactly the same footing as other languages for this purpose.
   The project of recognizing Esperanto as a principal language for
   examination was entirely impracticable. It is far too easy, and would
   merely have become a "soft option" and a refuge for the destitute.
</p>

<p>
   It is said that a majority of the Commission are in favour of
   introducing an auxiliary language into the schools, when one has been
   chosen by the Delegation or by the Association of Academies. It is
   therefore possible that in a year or two Esperanto may be officially
   recognized in France; and if this is so, other nations will have to
   examine the matter seriously.
</p>

<p>
   Considering that the French are notoriously bad linguists and, above
   all other peoples, devoted to the cult of their own language and
   literature, it is somewhat remarkable that the cause of an artificial
   language should have made more progress among them than elsewhere. It
   might have been anticipated that the obstructionist outcry, raised
   so freely in all countries by those who imagine that an insidious
   attack is being made on taste, culture, and national language and
   literature, would have been particularly loud in France. On the
   contrary, it is precisely in that country that the movement has made
   most popular progress, and that it numbers the most scientists,
   scholars, and distinguished men among its adherents. Is it that
   history will one day have to record another case of France leading
   Europe in the van of progress?
</p>

<p>
   Encouraged by the number of distinguished signatures obtained in
   France to their petition in 1901, the Delegation drew up a formula of
   assent to their Declaration, which they circulate amongst (1) members
   of academies, (2) members of universities, in all countries. They
   also keep a list of societies of all kinds who have declared their
   adherence to the scheme. The latest lists (February and March 1907)
   show 1,060 signatures of academicians and university members, and 273
   societies. In both cases the most influential backing is in France.
   Thus among the signatures figure in Paris alone:

   besides a host of other members of various learned bodies. Many of
   these are members of that august body the Institut de France, and one
   is a member of the Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise&mdash;M. Lavisse.
</p>

<p>
   It is the same in the other French Universities: Lyons University, 53
   professors; Dijon, 34; Caen, 18; Besan&ccedil;on, 15; Grenoble, 26;
   Marseilles, 56, and so on.
</p>

<p>
   Universities in other lands make a fair showing. America contributes
   supporters from John Hopkins University, 20 professors; Boston
   Academy of Arts and Sciences, 13 members; Harvard, 7 professors;
   Columbia University, 23 professors; Washington Academy of Science, 19
   members; Columbus University, Ohio, 21 professors, etc. Dublin and
   Edinburgh both contribute a few. England is represented by one entry:
   "Cambridge, 2 professors." Perhaps the Cambridge Congress will change
   this somewhat. It will be strange if any one can actually witness a
   congress without having his imagination to some extent stirred by the
   possibilities.
</p>

<p>
   A noticeable feature of the action of the Delegation throughout
   has been the scientific spirit in which it has gone to work, and
   its absolute impartiality as to the language to be adopted. It
   has everywhere, in its propaganda and circulars, spoken of "an
   international auxiliary language," and has been careful not to
   prejudge in any way the question as to which shall be adopted.
</p>

<p>
   It may be news to many that there are several rival languages in
   the field. Even the enthusiastic partisans of Esperanto are often
   completely ignorant of the existence of competitors. It was partly
   with the object of furnishing full information to the

<!-- 042.png -->

<a name="page033"> </a><span class = "pagenum">33</span>
   Delegates who are to make the choice, that MM. Couturat and Leau
   composed their admirable <i>Histoire de la langue universelle</i>. It
   contains a brief but scientific account of each language mentioned,
   the leading principles of its construction, and an excellent
   critique. The main principles are disengaged by the authors with
   a masterly clearness and precision of analysis from the mass of
   material before them. Though they are careful to express no personal
   preference, and let fall nothing which might unfairly prejudice the
   delegates in favour of any scheme, it is not difficult to judge, by
   a comparison of the scientific critiques, which of the competing
   schemes analysed most fully carries out the principles which
   experience now shows to be essential to success for any artificial
   language.
</p>

<p>
   The impression left is, that whether judged by the test of conformity
   to necessary principles, or by the old maxim "possession is nine
   points of the law," Esperanto has no serious rival.

      can the international language be latin?
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   There are some who fully admit the desirability of an international
   language, but say that we have no need to invent one, as we have
   Latin. This tends to be the argument of literary persons.<sup>1</sup> They back
   it up by pointing out that Latin has already done duty in the Middle
   Ages as a common medium, and therefore, they say, what it has once
   done with success it can do again.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>It has even cropped up again in the able articles in <i>The
   Times</i> on the reformed pronunciation of Latin (April 1907).
</p>

<p>
   It is hard to argue with such persons, because they have not grasped
   the fact that the nature of international communication has undergone
   a complete change, and that therefore there is no

<!-- 043.png -->

<a name="page034"> </a><span class = "pagenum">34</span>
   presumption that the same medium will suffice for carrying it on. In
   the Middle Ages the cosmopolitan public was almost entirely a learned
   one. The only people who wanted to communicate with foreigners
   (except for a certain amount of commerce) were scholars, and the only
   things they wanted to communicate about were learned subjects, mostly
   of a philosophical or literary nature, which Latin was adapted to
   express. The educated public was extremely small, and foreign travel
   altogether beyond the reach of all but the very few. The overwhelming
   mass of the people were illiterate, and fast tied to their native
   spot by lack of pence, lack of communications, and the general
   conditions of life.
</p>

<p>
   Now that everybody can read and write and get about, and all the
   conditions of life have changed, the cosmopolitan public, so far from
   being confined to a handful of scholars and merchants, extends down
   to and is largely made up of that terrible modern production, "the
   man in the street." It is quite ridiculous to pretend that because
   an Erasmus or a Casaubon could carry on literary controversies,
   with amazing fluency and hard-hitting, in Ciceronian Latin,
   therefore "the bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus" can
   give up the time necessary to obtaining a control of Latin sufficient
   for the conduct of his affairs, or for hobnobbing with his kind
   abroad.
</p>

<p>
   It is waste of time to argue with those who do not realize that the
   absolute essentials of any auxiliary language in these days are
   ease of acquirement and accessibility to all. There are actually
   some newspapers published in Latin and dealing with modern topics.
   As an amusement for the learned they are all very well; but the
   portentous periphrases to which they are reduced in describing
   tramway accidents or motor-cars, the rank obscurity of the terms in
   which advertisements of the most ordinary goods are veiled, ought to
   be enough to drive their illusions out of the heads of the modern
   champions of Latin for practical purposes. Let these persons take in
   the Roman <i>Vox Urbis</i> for a month or two, or get hold of a copy
   of the London <i>Alaudae</i>, and see how they feel then.
</p>

<!-- 044.png -->

<a name="page035"> </a><span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<p>
   A dim perception of the requirements of the modern world has inspired
   the various schemes for a barbarized and simplified Latin. It is
   almost incredible that the authors of such schemes cannot see that
   debased Latin suffers from all the defects alleged against an
   artificial language, plus quite prohibitory ones of its own, without
   attaining the corresponding advantages. It is just as artificial as
   an entirely new language, without being nearly so easy (especially
   to speak) or adaptable to modern life. It sins against the cardinal
   principle that an auxiliary language shall inflict no damage upon
   any natural one. In short, it disgusts both parties (scholars and
   tradesmen), and satisfies the requirements of neither. Those who
   want an easy language, within the reach of the intelligent person
   with only an elementary school groundwork of education, don't get
   it; and the scholarly party, who treat any artificial language as a
   cheap commercial scheme, have their teeth set on edge by unparalleled
   barbarisms, which must militate most seriously against the correct
   use of classical Latin.
</p>

<p>
   Such schemes are dead of their own dogginess.
</p>

<p>
   Latin, pure or mongrel, won't do.

   This chapter might be as short and dogmatic as Mark Twain's
   celebrated chapter upon snakes in Ireland. It would be enough to
   merely answer "No," but that the indefatigable Mr. Henderson, after
   running through three artificial languages of his own, has come
   to the conclusion that Greek is the thing. Certainly, as regards
   flexibility and power of word-formation, Greek would be better

<p>
   Jingoes are not wanting who say that it is unpatriotic of any
   Englishman to be a party to the introduction of a neutral language,
   because English is manifestly destined to be the language of the
   world.
</p>

<p>
   Reader, did you ever indulge in the mild witticism of asking a
   foreigner where the English are mentioned in the Bible? The answer,
   of course, is, <i>The meek shall inherit the earth</i>. But if the
   foreigner is bigger than you, don't tell him until you have got to a
   safe distance.
</p>

<p>
   It is this attitude of self-assertion, coupled with the tacit
   assumption that the others don't count much, that makes the English
   so detested on the Continent. It is well reflected in the claim to
   have their own language adopted as a common means of communication
   between all other peoples.
</p>

<p>
   This claim is not put forward in any spirit of deliberate insolence,
   or with the intention of ignoring other people's feelings; though
   the very unconsciousness of any arrogance in such an attitude really
   renders it more galling, on account of the tacit conclusion involved
   therein. It is merely the outcome of ignorance and of that want
   of tact which consists of inability to put oneself at the point
   of view of others. The interests of English-speaking peoples are
   enormous, far greater than those of any other group of nations united
   by a common bond of speech. But it is a form of narrow provincial
   ignorance to refuse on that account to recognize that, compared to
   the whole bulk of civilized people, the English speakers are in a
   small minority, and that the majority includes many high-spirited
   peoples with a strongly developed sense of nationality, and destined
   to play a very important part in the history of the world. Any sort
   of movement to have English or any other national language adopted
   officially as a universal auxiliary language would at once entail a

<!-- 046.png -->

<a name="page037"> </a><span class = "pagenum">37</span>
   boycott of the favoured language on the part of a ring of other
   powerful nations, who could not afford to give a rival the benefit
   of this augmented prestige. And it is precisely upon universality of
   adoption that the great use of an international language will depend.
</p>

<p>
   To sum up: the ignorance of contemporary history and fact displayed
   in the suggestion of giving the preference to any national language
   is only equalled by its futility, for it <i>is</i> futile, to
   put forward a scheme that has no chance of even being discussed
   internationally as a matter of practical politics.
</p>

<p>
   A proof is that precisely the same objection to an auxiliary language
   is raised in France&mdash;namely, that it is unpatriotic, because it
   would displace French from that proud position.
</p>

<p>
   The above remarks will be wholly misunderstood if they are taken
   to imply any spirit of Little Englandism on the part of the
   writer. On the contrary, he is ardently convinced of the mighty
   <i>r&ocirc;le</i> that will be played among the nations by the
   British Empire, and has had much good reason in going to and fro in
   the world to ponder on its unique achievement in the past. When fully
   organized on some terms of partnership as demanded by the growth of
   the Colonies, it will go even farther in the future. But all this has
   nothing to do with an international language. Howsoever mighty, the
   British Empire will not swallow up the earth&mdash;at any rate, not in
   our time. And till it does, it is not practical politics to expect
   other peoples to recognize English as the international language as
   between themselves.
</p>

<p>
   There are, in fact, two quite separate questions:
</p>

<p>
   (1) Supposing it is possible for any national language to become the
   international one, which has the best claims?
</p>

<p>
   (2) Is it possible for any national language to be adopted as the
   international one?
</p>

<p>
   To question (1) the answer undoubtedly is "English." It is already
   the language of the sea, and to a large extent the medium for
   transacting business between Europeans and Asiatic races, or

<!-- 047.png -->

<a name="page038"> </a><span class = "pagenum">38</span>
   between the Asiatic races themselves.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, except
   for its pronunciation and spelling, it has intrinsically the best
   claim, as being the furthest advanced along the common line of
   development of Aryan language.<sup>2</sup> But the discussion of this
   question has no more than an academic interest, because the answer to
   question (2) is, for political reasons, in the negative.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Another argument is that based on the comparative numbers
   of people who speak the principal European languages as their
   mother-tongue. No accurate statistics exist, but an interesting
   estimate is quoted by Couturat and Leau (<i>Hist. de la langue
   universelle</i>), which puts English first with about 120,000,000,
   followed at a distance of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 by Russian.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>2</sup>This is explained in <a href="#page135">Part&nbsp;III., chap.&nbsp;i.</a>,
   <i>q.v.</i>
</p>

<div class="chapitrotitolo" id="partIchapterX">
   X
   <div class="subtitolo">
      can the evolution of an international language be left to the process of natural selection by free competition?
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   "You base your argument for an international language mainly on the
   operation of economical laws. Be consistent, then; leave the matter
   to Nature. By unlimited competition the best language is bound to be
   evolved and come to the top in the struggle for life. Let the fittest
   survive, and don't bother about Esperanto."
</p>

<p>
   On a first hearing this sounds fairly plausible, yet it is
   honeycombed with error.
</p>

<p>
   In the first place, it proves too much. The same argument could be
   adduced for the abandonment of effort of all kind whatever to improve
   upon Nature and her processes. "You can walk and run and swim. Don't
   bother to invent boats and bicycles, trains and aeroplanes, that will
   bring you more into touch with other peoples. Let Nature evolve the
   best form of international locomotion."
</p>

<p>
   Again, Nature does not tend towards uniformity. She produces an
   infinity of variety in the individual, and out of this variety she
   selects and evolves certain prevailing types. But these types

<!-- 048.png -->

<a name="page039"> </a><span class = "pagenum">39</span>
   differ widely within the limits of the world under varying conditions
   of environment. What we are seeking to establish is world-wide
   uniformity, in spite of difference of environment.
</p>

<p>
   Again, the argument confuses a sub-characteristic with
   an organism. A language is not an organism, but one of the
   characteristics of man. After the lapse of countless ages there are
   grey horses and black, bay and chestnut, presumably because greyness
   and blackness and the rest are incidental characteristics of a horse.
   No one of them gives him a greater advantage than the others in his
   struggle for life, or helps him particularly to perform the functions
   of <!-- bona vorto: --> horsiness.
</p>

<p>
   Just in the same way a man may be equally well equipped with all
   the qualities that make for success, whether he speaks English
   or French, Russian or Japanese. It cannot be shown that language
   materially helps one people as against another, or even that the
   best race evolves the best language.<sup>1</sup> Take the last mentioned. If
   there is one people on the face of the globe who rejoice in an
   impossible language, it is the Japanese. In the early days of foreign
   intercourse a good Jesuit father reported that the Japanese were
   courteous and polite to strangers, but their language was plainly
   the invention of the devil. To a modern mind the language may have
   outlived its putative father, but its reputation has not improved,
   so far as ease is concerned. Yet who will say that it has impaired
   national efficiency?
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Greece went down before Rome. Which was the better race, meaning by
   "better" the more capable of imposing its language and manners on the
   world? Yet who doubts that Greek was the better language?
</p>

<p>
   The fact is, that for purposes of transaction of ordinary affairs
   by those who speak it as a mother tongue, one language is about as
   good as another. Whether it survives or spreads depends, not upon its
   intrinsic qualities as a language, but upon the success of the race
   that speaks it.<sup>1</sup> There is, therefore, no

<!-- 049.png -->

<a name="page040"> </a><span class = "pagenum">40</span>
   presumption that the best or the most suitable or the easiest
   language will spread over the world by its own merits, or even that
   any easy or regular language will be evolved. Printing and education
   have altogether arrested the natural process of evolution of language
   on the lips of men. This is one justification for the application of
   new artificial reforms to language and spelling, which tend no longer
   to move naturally with the times as heretofore.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>A curious phenomenon of our day suggests a possible partial
   exception. In Switzerland French is steadily encroaching and bearing
   back German. Is this owing to the intrinsic qualities of French
   language and civilization? Materially, the Germans have the greater
   expansive power.
</p>

<p>
   As regards free competition between rival artificial languages, the
   same considerations hold good. The worse might prevail just as easily
   as the better, because the determining factor is not the nature of
   the language, but the influence and general capacity of the rival
   backers. Of course a very bad or hard artificial language would not
   prevail against an easy one. But beyond a certain point of ease a
   universal language cannot go (ease meaning the ease of all), and that
   limit has probably been about reached now. Between future schemes
   there will be such a mere fractional difference in respect of ease,
   that competition becomes altogether beside the point. The thing is to
   take an easy one and stick to it.

   XI
   <div class="subtitolo">
      objections to an international language on aesthetic grounds
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   One of the commonest arguments that advocates of a universal language
   have to face runs something like this:
</p>

<p>
   "Yes, there really does seem to be something in what you
   say&mdash;your language may save time and money and grease the wheels
   of business; but, after all, we are not all business men, nor are
   we all out after dollars. Just think what a dull, drab uniformity
   your scheme would lay over the lands like a pall. By the artificial
   removal of natural barriers you are aiding and abetting the
   vulgarization of the world. You are doing what

<!-- 050.png -->

<a name="page041"> </a><span class = "pagenum">41</span>
   in you lies to eliminate the racy, the local, the picturesque.
   The tongues of men are as stately trees, set deep in the black,
   mouldering soil of the past, and rich with its secular decay.
   The leaves are the words of the people, old yet ever new, and
   the flowers are the nation's poems, drawing their life from the
   thousand tiny roots that twist and twine unseen about the lives and
   struggles of bygone men. You are calling to us to come forth from
   the cool seclusion of these trees' shade, to leave their delights
   and toil in the glare of the world at raising a mushroom growth
   on a dull, featureless plain that reaches <!-- bona vorto: -->
   everywhither. Modern Macbeths, sophisticated by your modernity and
   adding perverted instinct to crime, you are murdering not sleep,
   but dreams&mdash;dreams that haunt about the mouldering lodges of
   the past, and soften the contact with reality by lending their own
   colouring atmosphere. You are hammering the last nail into the coffin
   of the old leisurely past, the past that raised the cathedrals, to
   which taste and feeling were of supreme moment, and when man put
   something of himself into his every work."
</p>

<p>
   The man must be indeed dull of soul who cannot join in a dirge for
   the beauty of the vanishing past. Turn where we may now, we find the
   same railways, the same trams, music-halls, coats and trousers.
   The mad rush of modernity with its levelling tendency really is
   killing off what is quaint, out of the way, and racy of the soil.
   But why visit the sins of modernity upon an international language?
   The last sentence of the indictment itself suggests the line of
   defence. "You are hammering the last nail into the coffin of the old,
   leisurely past...."
</p>

<p>
   Quite so, you <i>are</i>.
</p>

<p>
   The universal ability to use an auxiliary language on occasion rounds
   off and completes the levelling process. But the old leisurely past
   will not be any the less dead, or any the less effectually buried, if
   one nail is not driven home in the coffin. The slayer is modernity at
   large, made up of science, steam, democracy, universal education, and
   many other things&mdash;but especially universal education. And the
   verdict can be, at the most,

<!-- 051.png -->

<a name="page042"> </a><span class = "pagenum">42</span>
   justifiable, or at any rate inevitable, <!-- bona vorto: -->
   pasticide. You cannot eat your cake and have it; you cannot kill off
   all the bad things and keep all the good ones. With sterilization
   goes purification, pasticide may be accompanied by pasteurization. At
   any rate, "the old order changeth," and you've got to let it change.
</p>

<p>
   The whole history of the "progress" of the world, meaning often
   material progress, is eloquent of the lesson that it is vain to set
   artificial limits to advancing invention. The substitution of cheap
   mechanical processes of manufacture for hand-work involved untold
   misery to many, and incidentally led to the partial disappearance
   of a type of character which the world could ill afford to lose,
   and which we would give much to be able to bring back. The old
   semi-artist-craftsman, with hand and eye really trained up to
   something like their highest level of capacity, with knowledge not
   wide, but deep, and all gained from experience, and not from books or
   technical education&mdash;this type of character is a loss. Many, with
   the gravest reason, are dissatisfied with the type which has already
   largely replaced it, and which will replace it for good or evil, but
   ever more swiftly and surely. But no well-judging person proposes on
   that account to forgo the material advantages conferred upon mankind
   by the invention of machinery. If the world rejects, on sentimental
   grounds, the labour-saving invention of international language, it
   will be flying in the face of economic history, and it will not
   appreciably retard the disappearance of the picturesque.
</p>

<p>
   There is another type of argument which may also be classed as
   aesthetic, but which differs somewhat from the one just discussed. It
   emanates chiefly from literary men and scholars, and may be presented
   as follows:
</p>

<p>
   "Language is precious, and worthy of study, inasmuch as it enshrines
   the imperishable monuments of the thought and genius of the race on
   whose lips it was born. The study of the words and forms in which a
   nation clothed its thoughts throws many a ray of light on phases of
   the evolution of the race itself, which

<!-- 052.png -->

<a name="page043"> </a><span class = "pagenum">43</span>
   would otherwise have remained dark. The history of a language and
   literature is in some measure an epitome of the history of a people.
   We miss all these points of interest in your artificial language, and
   we shall, therefore, refuse to study it, and hereby commit it to the
   devil."
</p>

<p>
   This is a particularly humiliating type of answer to receive, because
   it implies that one is an ass. In truth the man who should invent
   an artificial language and invite the world to study it for itself
   would be a fool, and a very swell-headed fool at that. It seems in
   vain to point this out to persons who use the above argument; or to
   explain to them that they would be aided in their study of languages
   that do repay study by the introduction of an easy international
   language, because many commentaries, etc., would become accessible
   to them, which are not so now, or only at the expense of deciphering
   some difficult language in which the commentary is written, the
   commentary itself being in no sense literature, and its form a matter
   of complete indifference.
</p>

<p>
   Back comes the old answer in one form or another, every variation
   tainted with the heresy that the language is to be studied as a
   language for itself.
</p>

<p>
   Perhaps the least tedious way of giving an idea of this kind of
   opposition, and the way in which it may be met, is to give some
   extracts from a scholar's letter, and the writer's answer. The letter
   is fairly typical.

      will an international language discourage the study of modern languages,
      and thus be detrimental to culture?&mdash;parallel with the question of
      compulsory greek
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   There is a broad, twofold distinction in the aims with which the
   study of foreign languages is organized and undertaken.
</p>

<p>
   It serves: first, purely utilitarian ends, and is a means; secondly,
   the purposes of culture, and is an end in itself.
</p>

<p>
   An international auxiliary language aims at supplanting the first
   type of study completely, and, as it claims, with profit to the
   students. The second type it hopes to leave wholly intact, and
   disclaims any attempt to interfere with it in any way. How far is
   this possible?
</p>

<p>
   The answer depends mainly upon the efficiency of the alternative

<!-- 056.png -->

<a name="page047"> </a><span class = "pagenum">47</span>
   offered by the new-comer in each case as a possible
   substitute.
</p>

<p>
   Firstly, if it is true that a great portion of the human race,
   especially in the big polyglot empires and the smaller states of
   Europe, are groaning under the incubus of the language difficulty,
   and have to spend years on the study of mere words before they can
   fit themselves for an active career, then the abolition of this heavy
   handicap on due preparation for each man's proper business in life
   will liberate much time for more profitable studies. It is certain
   that the majority of mankind are non-linguistic by nature and
   inclination rather than linguistic&mdash;i.e. that the best chance
   of developing their natural capacities to the utmost and making them
   useful and agreeable members of society does not lie in making all
   alike swallow an overdose of foreign languages during the acquisitive
   years of youth. By doing so, vast waste is caused, taking the world
   round. As to the attainment of the object of this first type of
   language study, not only is it as efficiently secured by a single
   universal language, but far more so. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> the object
   is utilitarian; the language is a means. Well, a universal language
   is a better means than a national one&mdash;first, because, being
   universal, it is a means to more; secondly, because, being easy and
   one, it is a means that more people can grasp and employ. In fact,
   it is in this field an efficient substitute; it saves much, without
   losing anything.
</p>

<p>
   For the second type of language-study, on the other hand, where
   the end is culture and the language is studied for itself and in no
   wise as an indifferent means, a universal artificial language offers
   no substitute at all. This end is not on its programme. Why, then,
   should any language-study that is organized in view of culture
   be given up on its account?
</p>

<p>
   It may, of course, be said that the time given to it by those who
   pursue culture in language will be taken from the time devoted to
   more worthy linguistic study, and will therefore prejudice the
   learning of other languages. This is a point of technical pedagogics
   or psychology. There is very good reason,

<!-- 057.png -->

<a name="page048"> </a><span class = "pagenum">48</span>
   from the standpoint of these sciences, to believe that a study of
   a simple <i>type-tongue</i> would, on the contrary, pay for itself
   in increased facility in learning other languages. But this is more
   fully discussed in the chapter for teachers
   (<a href="#partIIIchapterII">Part&nbsp;III., chap.&nbsp;ii.</a>).
</p>

<p>
   The question, however, is not in reality quite so simple as this.
   There is no water-tight partition between utilitarian and cultural
   language-study. They act and react upon each other. There really
   is some ground for anxiety, lest the provision of facilities for
   learning an easy artificial language at your door may prevent people
   from going out of their way to learn national ones, which would have
   awakened scholarly instincts in them. The cause of culture would thus
   sustain some real hurt.
</p>

<p>
   The question is another phase&mdash;a wider and lower-grade
   phase&mdash;of the great compulsory Greek question at Oxford and
   Cambridge. It affects the masses, whereas the Greek controversy
   affects the few at the top; but otherwise the issue at stake is
   essentially the same.
</p>

<p>
   In both cases the bedrock of the problem is this, Can we afford to
   put the many through a grind, which is on the whole unprofitable to
   them and does not attain its object of conferring culture, in order
   to uphold the traditional system in the interests of the few? In
   neither case do the reformers desire to suppress the study of the
   old culture-giving language; rather it is hoped that the interests
   of scholarly and liberal learning will benefit by being freed from
   the dead weight of grammar grinders, whose mechanical performance
   and monkey antics are merely a dodge to catch a copper from the
   examiners.
</p>

<p>
   When Greek is no longer bolstered up by the protection of compulsion,
   some of the present bounty-fed (i.e. compulsion-fed) facilities for
   its study will no doubt disappear from the schools which are at
   present forced to provide them. With them will be lost some recruits
   who would have been led by the facilities to study Greek, and would
   have studied it to their profit. On the other hand, the university
   will be open to numbers of students who are at present shut out by
   the Greek tariff. Another barrier

<a name="page049"> </a><span class = "pagenum">49</span>
   against modernity will go down, and democracy make another step out
   of the proverbial gutter towards the university.
</p>

<p>
   Similarly, the possession of a universally understood medium of
   communication will in some cases deter people from making the effort
   to study real language, with all the treasures of original literature
   to which it is the key.
</p>

<center>
   "Tis true, 'tis pity; and pity 'tis, 'tis true.
</center>

<p>
   But&mdash;and this is the great point&mdash;it will open the
   cosmopolitan outlook to countless thousands who could never hope to
   grapple successfully with even one national language. This cannot be
   a small gain.
</p>

<p>
   It all comes back to this&mdash;you cannot eat your cake and have it
   too. <i>Il faut souffrir pour &ecirc;tre belle.</i> The international
   language has the defects of its qualities. But then its qualities are
   great, and the world is their sphere of utility.

      objection to an international language on the ground that it will soon
      split up into dialects
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   This is a particularly unfortunate objection, because it displays a
   radical ignorance of the history of language, and of the conditions
   under which it develops.
</p>

<p>
   In the first place, the whole tendency of language in the modern
   world is towards disappearance of local dialects, and their
   absorption into a uniform literary language. The dialects of England
   are almost dead before the onset of universal education, and the
   great work of Dr. Wright was only just in time to rescue them from
   oblivion. Even one generation hence it will be impossible to collect
   much of the local speech recorded in his dictionary. It is the same
   in Germany and everywhere, though, of course, all countries are
   not equally advanced in this respect. A standard form of words and
   grammar is fixed by print for the

<!-- 059.png -->

<a name="page050"> </a><span class = "pagenum">50</span>
   literary language, and when every one can read and write, it is all
   up with national evolution of language, such as has produced all
   national languages. A gradual change of the phonetic value given
   to the written symbols there may be. This has been pre-eminently
   the case in England, though even this will now be arrested by
   universal education. But a change of forms or of grammar can only be
   indefinitely slight and gradual. When it takes place, it reflects a
   common advance of the literary language, and not local or dialectical
   variation (though the common advance may have originally spread from
   one locality).
</p>

<p>
   In the second place, dialects are variations that spring up under the
   stress of local circumstance in the familiar every-day unconscious
   use of a common mother tongue among people of the same race and
   inhabiting the same district. Now, these are the very circumstances
   in which an auxiliary international language never can, and never
   will, be used. The only exception is the case of people meeting
   together for the conscious practice of the language or using it in
   jest.
</p>

<p>
   There are no occasions when an international language would be
   naturally used when any variation from standard usage would not be a
   distinct disadvantage as tending to unintelligibility. In short, a
   neutral language consciously learned as a means of communication with
   strangers is not on an equal footing with, or exposed to the same
   influences as, a mother tongue used by people every day under like
   conditions.
</p>

<p>
   A cardinal point of difference is well illustrated by Esperanto.
   The whole foundation of the language, vocabulary, grammar, and
   everything else, is contained in one small book of a few pages,
   called <i>Fundamento de Esperanto</i>. No change can be made in this
   except by a competent elected international authority. Of course, no
   text-books or grammars will be authorized for the use of any nation
   that are not in accordance with the <i>Fundamento</i>. People will
   make mistakes, of course, just as they make mistakes in any foreign
   language, and they can help themselves out with any words from other
   languages, just as they do now when their

<!-- 060.png -->

<a name="page051"> </a><span class = "pagenum">51</span>
   French or German fails them. But the standard is always there, simple
   and short, to correct any aberration, and there is no room for any
   alterations in form or structure to creep in.

   <div class="subtitolo">
      objection that the present international language (esperanto) is
      too dogmatic, and refuses to profit by criticism
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   It is true that Esperantists refuse to make any change in their
   language at present, and this is found irritating by some able
   critics, who wrongly imagine that this attitude amounts to a claim of
   perfection for Esperanto. The matter may be easily put right.
</p>

<p>
   The inadmissibility of change (even for the better) is purely
   a matter of policy and dictated by practical considerations.
   Esperantists make no claim to infallibility; they want to see their
   language universally adopted, and they want to see it as perfect as
   possible. Actual and bitter experience shows that the international
   language which admits change is lost. Universal acceptance and
   present change are incompatible. Esperantists, therefore, bow to the
   inevitable and deliberately choose to concentrate for the present
   on acceptance. General acceptance, indeed, while it imposes upon
   the present body of Esperantists self-restraint in abstaining from
   change, is in reality the essential condition of profitable future
   amendment. When an international language has attained the degree of
   dissemination already enjoyed by Esperanto, the only safe kind of
   change that can be made is <i>a posteriori</i>, not <i>a priori</i>.
   When Esperanto has been officially adopted and comes into wide use,
   actual experience and consensus of usage amongst its leading writers
   will indicate the modifications that are ripe for official adoption.
   The competent international official authority will then from time to
   time duly register such changes, and they will become officially part
   of the language.
</p>

<!-- 061.png -->

<a name="page052"> </a><span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<p>
   Till then, any change can only cause confusion and alienate support.
   No one is going to spend time learning a language which is one thing
   to-day and another thing to-morrow. When the time comes
   for change, the authority will only proceed cautiously one step at a
   time, and its decrees will only set the seal upon that which actual
   use has hit off.
</p>

<p>
   This, then, is the explanation of the famous adjective
   "netu&#349;ebla," applied by Dr. Zamenhof to his language, and so
   much resented in certain quarters. Surely not only is this degree
   of dogmatism amply justified by practical considerations, but it
   would amount to positive imprudence on the part of Esperantists to
   act otherwise. If the inventor of the language can show sufficient
   self-restraint, after long years spent in touching and
   retouching his language, to hold his hand at a given point (and he
   has declared that self-restraint is necessary), surely others
   need not be hurt at their suggestions not being adopted, even though
   they may in some cases be real improvements.
</p>

<p>
   The following extracts, translated from the Preface to <i>Fundamento
   de Esperanto</i> (the written basic law of Esperanto), should set
   the question in the right light. It will be seen that Dr. Zamenhof
   expressly contemplates the "gradual perfection" (<i>perfektigado</i>)
   of his language, and by no means lays claim to finality or
   infallibility.
</p>

<p>
   "Having the character of <i>fundament</i>, the three works
   reprinted in this volume must be above all inviolable
   (<i>netu&#349;eblaj</i>).... The fundament must remain inviolable
   <i>even with its errors....</i> Having once lost its strict
   inviolability, the work would lose its exceptional and necessary
   character of dogmatic fundamentality; and the user, finding one
   translation in one edition, and another in another, would have no
   security that I should not make another change to-morrow, and
   his confidence and support would be lost.
</p>

<p>
   "To any one who shows me an expression that is not good in the
   Fundamental book, I shall calmly reply: Yes, it is an error; but it
   must remain inviolable, for it belongs to the fundamental

<a name="page053"> </a><span class = "pagenum">53</span>
   document, in which no one has the right to make any change.... I
   showed, <i>in principle</i>, how the strict inviolability of the
   <i>Fundamento</i> will always preserve the unity of our language,
   without however preventing the language not only from becoming
   richer, but even from constantly becoming more perfect. But <i>in
   practice</i> we (for causes already many times explained) must
   naturally be very cautious in the process of 'perfecting' the
   language: (<i>a</i>) we must not do this light-heartedly,
   but only in case of absolute necessity; (<i>b</i>) it can only be
   done (after mature judgment) by some central institution, having
   indisputable authority for the whole Esperanto world, and not by any
   private persons....
</p>

<p>
   "Until the time when a central authoritative institution shall decide
   to <i>augment</i> (never to <i>change</i>) the existing fundament by
   rendering official new words or rules, everything good, which is not
   to be found in the <i>Fundamento de Esperanto</i>, is to be regarded
   not as compulsory, but only as recommended."

<p>
   An attempt has been made in the preceding chapters to deal with
   the more important and obvious arguments put forward by those who
   will hear nothing of an international language. The objections are,
   however, so numerous, cover such a wide field, and in some cases are
   so mutually destructive, that it may be instructive to present them

   If the business of an argument is to be unanswerable, the place of
   honour certainly belongs to the religious argument. Any one who
   really believes that an international language is an impious attempt
   to reverse the judgment of Babel will continue firm in his faith,
   though one speak with the tongues of men and of angels.
</p>

<p>
   Here, then, are the objections, classified according to content.

<p align="center" class="majusklete">
   Objections to an International Language
</p>

<p>
   I. <i>Religious</i>.
</p>

<p>
   It is doomed to confusion, because it reverses the judgment of Babel.
</p>

<p>
   II. <i>Aesthetic and sentimental</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (1) It is a cheap commercial scheme, unworthy of the attention of
   scholars.
</p>

<p>
   (2) It vulgarizes the world and tends to dull uniformity.
</p>

<p>
   (3) It weakens patriotism by diluting national spirit with
   cosmopolitanism.
</p>

<p>
   (4) It has no history, no link with the past.
</p>

<p>
   (5) It is artificial, which is a sin in itself.
</p>

<p>
   III. <i>Political</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (1) It is against English [Frenchmen read "French"] interests, as
   diverting prestige from the national tongue.
</p>

<p>
   (2) It is socialistic and even anarchical in tendency, and will
   facilitate the operations of the international disturbers of society.
</p>

<p>
   IV. <i>Literary and linguistic</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (1) Lacking history and associations, it is unpoetical and unsuited
   to render the finer shades of thought and feeling. It will,
   therefore, degrade and distort the monuments of national literatures
   which may be translated into it.
</p>

<p>
   (2) It may even discourage authors, ambitious of a wide public, from
   writing in their own tongue. Original works in the artificial


<!-- 064.png -->

<a name="page055"> </a><span class = "pagenum">55</span>
   language can never have the fine savour of a master's use of his
   mother tongue.
</p>

<p>
   (3) Its precisely formal and logical vocabulary and construction
   debauches the literary sense for the niceties of expression.
   Therefore, even if not used as a substitute for the mother tongue,
   its concurrent use, which will be thrust on everybody, will weaken
   the best work in native idioms.
</p>

<p>
   (4) It will split up into dialects.
</p>

<p>
   (5) Pronunciation will vary so as to be unintelligible.
</p>

<p>
   (6) It is too dogmatic, and refuses to profit by criticism.
</p>

<p>
   V. <i>Educational and cultural</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (1) It will prejudice the study of modern languages.
</p>

<p>
   (2) It will provide a "soft option" for examinees.
</p>

<p>
   VI. <i>Personal and particular</i>.
</p>

<p>
   It is prejudicial to the vested interests of modern language
   teachers, foreign correspondence clerks, interpreters, multilingual
   waiters and hotel porters.
</p>

<p>
   VII. <i>Technical</i>.
</p>

<p>
   This heading includes the criticisms in detail of various
   schemes&mdash;e.g. it is urged against Esperanto that its accent
   is monotonous; that its accusative case is unnecessary; that its
   principle of word-formation from roots is not strictly logical;
   that its vocabulary is too Romance; that its vocabulary is not
   Romance enough; and so forth.
</p>

<p>
   VIII. <i>Popular</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (1) It is a wild idea put forth by a set of cranks, who would be
   better occupied in something else.
</p>

<p>
   (2) It is impossible.
</p>

<p>
   (3) It is too hard: life isn't long enough.
</p>

<p>
   (4) It is not hard enough: lessons will be too quickly done, and will
   not sink into the mind.
</p>

<p>
   (5) It will oust all other languages, and thus destroy each nation's
   birthright and heritage.
</p>

<!-- 065.png -->

<a name="page056"> </a><span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<p>
   (6) It will not come in in our time, so the question is of no
   interest except to our grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
   (7) It is doomed to failure&mdash;look at Volap&uuml;k!
</p>

<p>
   (8) There are quite enough languages already.
</p>

<p>
   (9) You have to learn three or four languages in order to understand
   Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   (10) You cannot know it without learning it.
</p>

<p>
   (11) You have to wear a green star.
</p>

<p>
   Pains have been taken to make this list exhaustive. If any reader can
   think of another objection, he is requested to communicate with the
   author.
</p>

<p>
   Most of the serious arguments have been already dealt with, so that
   not many words need be said here. As regards No. VII. (Technical),
   this is not the place to deal with actual criticisms of the language
   (Esperanto) that holds the field. The reader will not be in a
   position to judge of them till he has learnt it. Suffice it to say
   that they can all be met, and some of the points criticised as vices
   are, in reality, virtues in an artificial language.
</p>

<p>
   As for Nos. II. and IV. (Sentimental and Literary), most of these
   objections are due to the old heresy of the literary man, that an
   artificial language claims to compete with natural languages <i>as
   a language</i>. Once realize that it is primarily a labour-saving
   device, and therefore to be judged like any other modern invention
   such as telegraphy or shorthand, and most of these objections fall to
   the ground.
</p>

<p>
   A good many of the objections cannot be taken seriously (though they
   have all been seriously made), or refute themselves or each other.
   No. VIII. (10) sounds like a fake, but this was the criticism of a
   scholar and linguist who had been persuaded to look at Esperanto. He
   complained that though he, knowing Latin, French, Italian, German,
   and English, could read it without ever having learnt it, ordinary
   Englishmen could not. It is usual to judge an invention by efficiency
   compared to cost, but if an appliance is to be condemned because
   it needs some trouble to master it, then not many inventions will
   survive.
</p>

<!-- 066.png -->

<a name="page057"> </a><span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<p>
   No. VIII. (9) is of course a mistake. It is like saying that you must
   practice looping the loop or circus-riding in order to keep your
   balance on a bicycle. The greater, of course, includes the less; but
   it is better in both cases to begin with the less. It is much more
   reasonable to reverse the argument and say: If you begin by learning
   Esperanto, you will possess a valuable aid towards learning three or
   four national languages.
</p>

<p>
   No. VIII. (5) is absurd. It is the hardest thing in the world to
   extirpate a national language; and all the forces of organized
   repression (e.g. in unhappy Poland) are finding the task too much
   for them. What inducement have the common people, who form the
   bulk of the population in every land, to substitute in their home
   intercourse for their own language one that they have to learn, if at
   all, artificially at school? Only those who have much international
   intercourse will ever become really at home in international
   language&mdash;i.e. sufficiently at home to make it possible to use
   it indifferently as a substitute for their mother-tongue;
   and people who engage in prolonged and continuous international
   intercourse, though numerous, will always be in a minority.

      the wider cosmopolitanism&mdash;the coming of asia
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   In the civilized West, where pleasure, business, and science are
   daily forging new ties of common interests between the nations,
   those engaged in such pursuits have clearly much to gain from the
   simplification of their pursuits by a common language. But let
   us look ahead a little further still. It may well be that the
   outstanding feature of the twentieth century in history will be the
   coming into line of the peoples of Asia with their pioneer brethren
   of the West. Look where you will, everywhere the symptoms are
   plain for those who can read them. Japan has led the way. China is
   following, and will not be far behind; eventually, as the Japanese
   themselves foresee, she will probably outstrip Japan, if

<!-- 067.png -->

<a name="page058"> </a><span class = "pagenum">58</span>
   not the world. There seems to be no ground, ethnological or
   otherwise, for thinking that the lagging behind of Asia in modern
   civilization corresponds to a real inferiority of powers, mental or
   physical, in the individual Asiatic. Experience shows that under
   suitable conditions the Asiatic can efficiently handle all the white
   man's tools and weapons; the complete coming up to date is largely
   a matter of organization, education, and the possession of a few
   really able men at the head of affairs. Given these, progress may be
   astonishingly quick. Europeans do not yet seem to have grasped at all
   adequately the real significance of the last fifty years of Japanese
   history. Do they really think that the Chinaman is inferior to the
   Japanese? If so, let them ask any residents in the Far East. Can it
   be maintained that a generation ago the peasant of Eastern Europe
   was ahead of the country Chinaman? But the last few years have shown
   how swiftly modern civilization spreads, both in Europe and America,
   from the comparatively small group of nations which in the main
   have worked it out to the others, till lately considered backward
   and semi-barbarous. And this is the case not merely with the
   material products of civilization, the railway and the telegraph,
   but also as regards its divers manifestations in all that concerns
   the life of the people&mdash;constitutional government with growth
   of representative, elected authorities and democracy; universal
   education with universal power of reading and consequent birth of
   a cheap press; rise of industry and consequent growth of towns;
   universal military service <!-- nur por viroj! --> and discipline,
   now in force in most lands; rise of a moneyed and leisured class and
   consequent growth of sport, and of all kinds of clubs and societies
   for promoting various interests, social, sporting, political,
   religious, educational, philanthropic, and so forth. In fact, the
   more the material side of life is "modernized," the more closely
   do the citizens of all lands approximate to one another in their
   interests and activities, which ultimately rest upon and grow out of
   their material conditions. Meantime wealth and consequently foreign
   travel everywhere increase, fresh facilities of communication are
   constantly provided,

<!-- 068.png -->

<a name="page059"> </a><span class = "pagenum">59</span>
   men from different countries are more and more thrown
   together, and all this makes for the further strengthening of mutual
   interests and the growth of fresh ones in common.
</p>

<p>
   Now if (1) under the stress of "modernization" life is already
   becoming so similar in the lands of the West, and if (2) the Asiatic
   is not fundamentally inferior in mental and physical endowments,
   then it follows as a certainty that the Asiatic world will, under
   the same stress, enter the comity of nations, and approximate to
   the world-type of interest and activity. It is only a question of
   time. In economic history nothing is more certain than that science,
   organization, cheapness, and efficiency must ultimately prevail over
   sporadic, unorganized local effort based on tradition and not on
   scientific exploitation of natural advantages. Thus the East will
   adopt the material civilization of the West; and through the same
   organization of industrial and commercial life and generally similar
   economic conditions, the same type of moneyed class will grow up,
   with the same range of interests on the intellectual and social side,
   diverse indeed, but in their very diversity conforming more and more
   to the world-type.
</p>

<p>
   Concurrently with this new tendency to uniformity proceeds the
   weakening of the two most powerful disintegrating influences of
   primitive humanity&mdash;religion and tradition. In the earlier
   stages of society these are the two most powerful agents for binding
   together into groups men already associated by the ties of locality
   and common ancestry, and fettering them in the cast-iron bonds of
   custom and ceremonial observance. While the members of each group
   are thus held together by the ideas which appeal most profoundly to
   unsophisticated mankind, the various groups are automatically and by
   the same process held apart by the full force of those ideas. Thus
   are produced castes, with their deadening opposition to all progress;
   and thus arise crusades, wars of religion and persecutions. Religion
   and tradition are then at once the mightiest integrants within
   each single community, and the mightiest disintegrants as between
   different communities.
</p>

<p>
   But this narrow and dissevering spirit of caste dies back before

<!-- 069.png -->

<a name="page060"> </a><span class = "pagenum">60</span>
   the spread of knowledge. The tendency to regard a man as unclean
   or a barbarian, simply because he does not believe or behave as
   one's own people, is merely a product of isolation and ignorance,
   and disappears with education and the general opening up of
   a country. The inquisitor can no longer boast of "strained
   relations"&mdash;strained physically on the rack, owing to differences
   of religious opinion. The state of things which made it possible for
   sepoys to revolt because rifle bullets were greased with the fat of
   a sacred animal, or for yellow men to tear up railway tracks because
   the magic desecrated the tombs of their ancestors, is rapidly passing
   away, as Orientals realize the profits to be made from scientific
   methods.
</p>

<p>
   Thus the levelling influence is at work, and the checks upon it are
   diminishing. The end can be but one. There will be a greater and
   greater similarity of life and occupation the world over, and more
   and more actual and potential international intercourse.
</p>

<p>
   Now, the further we move in this direction, the greater will be the
   impatience of vexatious restraints upon the freedom of intercourse;
   and of these restraints the difference of language is one of the most
   vexatious, because it is one of the easiest to remove. If we devote
   millions of pounds to annihilating the barriers of space, can we not
   devote a few months to the comparatively modest effort necessary to
   annihilate the barriers of language?
</p>

<p>
   A real cosmopolitanism, in the etymological sense of the word,
   <i>world</i> (and not merely European) citizenship, will shift the
   <i>onus probandi</i> from the supporters of an international language
   to its opponents. It will say to them, "It is admitted that you have
   much intercourse with other peoples; it is admitted that diversity
   of language is an obstacle in this intercourse; this obstacle is
   increasing rather than diminishing as fresh subjects raise their
   claims upon the few years of education, and the old leisurely type
   of linguistic education fails more and more to train the bulk of the
   people for life's business, and as the ranks of the civilized are
   swelled by fresh peoples for whom it is harder and harder to learn

<!-- 070.png -->

<a name="page061"> </a><span class = "pagenum">61</span>
   even one Indo-Germanic tongue, let alone several; it is
   proved that this obstacle can be removed at the cost of a few
   months' study: this study is not only the most directly remunerative
   study in the world, comparing results with cost, but it is an
   admirable mental discipline and a direct help towards further real
   linguistic culture-giving studies for those who are fit to
   undertake them. Show cause, then, why you prefer to suffer under an
   unnecessary obstacle, rather than avail yourselves of this means of
   removing it." It is easier for the Indo-Germanic peoples to
   learn each other's languages&mdash;e.g. for an Englishman to learn
   Swedish or Russian&mdash;than it is for a speaker of one of any of
   the other families of languages to learn any Indo-Germanic
   tongue; so that some idea may be formed of the magnitude of the
   task imposed upon the newer converts to Western civilization by the
   Indo-Germanic world, in making them learn one or more of its
   national languages. At the same time, it is but just that the peoples
   who have paid the piper of progress should call the common lingual
   tune. Therefore, what more fitting than that they should provide
   an essence of their allied languages, reduced to its simplest and
   clearest form? This they would offer to the rest of the world to be
   taken over as part of the general progress in civilization which it
   has to adopt; and this it is which is provided in the international
   language, Esperanto.

   <div class="subtitolo">
      importance of an international language for the blind
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   Now that higher education for the blind is being extended in every
   country, owing to the more humanitarian feeling of the present age
   that these afflicted members of the community ought to be given a
   fair chance, the problem of supplying them with books is beginning to
   be felt. The process of producing books for the blind on the Braille
   system is, of course, far more costly than ordinary printing, and at
   the same time the editions must

<!-- 071.png -->

<a name="page062"> </a><span class = "pagenum">62</span>
   be necessarily more or less limited. Many an educated blind person
   is therefore cruelly circumscribed in the range of literature open
   to him by the mere physical obstacle of the lack of books. This
   difficulty is accentuated by the fact that three kinds of Braille
   type are in use&mdash;French, English, and American.
</p>

<p>
   Now, suppose it is desired to make the works of some good author
   accessible to the blind&mdash;we will say the works of Milton. A
   separate edition has to be done into Braille for the English, another
   separate translation for the French, and so on for the blind of
   each country. In many cases where translations of a work do not
   already exist, as in the case of a modern author, the mere cost of
   translation into some one language may not pay, much less then the
   preparation of a special Braille edition for the limited blind public
   of that country. But if one Braille edition is prepared for the blind
   of the world in the universal auxiliary language, a far greater range
   of literature is at once brought within their grasp.
</p>

<p>
   Already there is abundant evidence of the keen appreciation of
   Esperanto on the part of the blind, and one striking proof is the
   fact that the distinguished French scientist and doctor, Dr. Javal,
   who himself became blind during the latter part of his life, was,
   until his death in March 1907, one of the foremost partisans and
   benefactors of Esperanto. By his liberality much has been rendered
   possible that could not otherwise have been accomplished. There
   are many other devoted workers in the same field, among them Prof.
   Cart and Mme. Fauvart-Bastoul in France, and Mr. Rhodes, of
   Keighley, and Mr. Adams, of Hastings, in England. A special fund is
   being raised to enable blind Esperantists from various countries to
   attend the Congress at Cambridge in August 1907, and the cause is one
   well worthy of assistance by all who are interested in the welfare
   of the blind. The day when a universal language is practically
   recognised will be one of the greatest in their annals.
</p>

<p>
   A perfectly phonetic language, as is Esperanto, is peculiarly suited
   to the needs of the blind. Its long, full vowels, slow,

<!-- 072.png -->

<a name="page063"> </a><span class = "pagenum">63</span>
   harmonious intonation, few and simple sounds, and regular
   construction make it very easy to learn through the ear, and to
   reproduce on any phonetic system of notation; and as a matter of
   fact, blind people are found to enjoy it much. For a blind man to
   come to an international congress and be able to compare notes with
   his fellow-blind from all over the world must be a lifting of
   the veil between him and the outer world, coming next to receiving
   his sight. To witness this spectacle alone might almost convince a
   waverer as to the utility of the common language.

   </div>
</div>

<p>
   From the early days of the Esperanto movement there has flowed within
   it a sort of double current. There is the warm and genial Gulf Stream
   of Idealism, that raises the temperature on every shore to which it
   sets, and calls forth a luxuriant growth of friendly sentiment. This
   tends to the enriching of life. There is also the cooler current of
   practicality, with a steady drive towards material profit. At present
   the tide is flowing free, and, taken at the flood, may lead on to
   fortune; the two currents pursue their way harmoniously within it,
   without clashing, and sometimes mingling their waters to their mutual
   benefit.
</p>

<p>
   But as the movement is sometimes dismissed contemptuously as a
   pacifist fad or an unattainable ideal of universal brotherhood, it
   is as well to set the matter in its true light. It is true that
   the inventor of Esperanto, Dr. Zamenhof, of Warsaw, is an idealist
   in the best sense of the word, and that his language was directly
   inspired by his ardent wish to remove one cause of misunderstanding
   in his distracted country. He has persistently refused to make any
   profit out of it, and declined to accept a sum which some enthusiasts
   collected as a testimonial to his disinterested work.
</p>

<!-- 073.png -->

<a name="page064"> </a><span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<p>
   It is equally true that Esperanto seems to possess a rather strange
   power of evoking enthusiasm. Meetings of Esperantists are invariably
   characterized by great cordiality and good-fellowship, and at the
   international congresses so far these feelings have at times risen
   to fever heat. It is easy to make fun of this by saying that the
   conjunction of Sirius, the fever-shedding constellation of the
   ancients, with the <!-- chu?: --> green star<sup>1</sup> in the dog days of
   August, when the congresses are held, induces hot fits. Those who
   have drunk enthusiastic toasts in common, and have rubbed shoulders
   and compared notes with various foreigners, and gone home having made
   perhaps lifelong interesting friendships which bring them in touch
   with other lands, will not undervalue the brotherhood aspect of the
   common language.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Badge of the Esperantists.
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, the united Esperantists at their first
   international meeting expressly and formally dissociated their
   project from any connection with political, sentimental, or
   peace-making schemes. They did this by drawing up and
   promulgating a "Deklaracio," adopted by the Esperantist world,
   wherein it is declared that Esperanto is a language, and a language
   only.<sup>1</sup> It is not a league or a society or agency for
   promoting any object whatsoever other than its own dissemination as
   a means of communication. Like other tongues, Esperanto may be used
   for any purpose whatsoever, and it is declared that a man is equally
   an Esperantist whether he uses the language to save life or to kill,
   to further his own selfish ends or to labour in any altruistic
   cause.<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>See the <a href="#deklaracio">text of this Declaration</a>.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>2</sup>The non-sectarian nature of Esperanto is shown by the
   fact that the first two services in the language were held on the
   same day in Geneva according to the Roman Catholic and Protestant
   rites. The latter was conducted by an English clergyman, whose
   striking sermon on unity, in spite of diversity, evidently impressed
   his international congregation. The Vatican has officially expressed
   its favour towards Esperanto, and the Archbishop of Canterbury has
   sanctioned an Esperanto form of the Anglican service, which will
   be used in London and Cambridge this summer. Cordial goodwill was
   expressed towards the Vatican, on receipt of its message at Geneva,
   by speakers who avowed themselves agnostics, but welcomed any advance
   towards abolition of barriers.
</p>

<!-- 074.png -->

<a name="page065"> </a><span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<p>
   The practical nature of the scheme which Esperantists are labouring
   to induce the world to adopt is thus sufficiently clearly defined.
   Dr. Zamenhof himself, speaking at the Geneva Congress with all the
   vivid poignancy attaching to the words of a man fresh from the
   butcheries at that moment rife in the Russian Empire,<sup>1</sup> declared
   that neither he nor other Esperantists were <i>naifs</i> enough to
   believe that the adoption of their language would put an end to
   such scenes. But he had <i>seen</i> men at each other's throats,
   beating each other's brains out with bludgeons&mdash;men who had no
   personal enmity and had never seen each other before, but were let
   loose on each other by pure race prejudice. He <i>did</i> claim that
   mutual incomprehensibility amongst men who thus dwell side by side
   and should be taking part in a common civic life was one powerful
   influence in keeping up cliques and divisions, and artificially
   holding asunder those whom common interests should be joining
   together. It is hard to refuse credence to this power of language,
   thus moderately stated.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>There were bad massacres about that time in Warsaw, where Dr.
   Zamenhof lives. During the Congress news came of the assassination of
   one of the chief civic officials of Warsaw.

   afterwards. The moral is, that it is no good to make exaggerated
   claims for a universal language. To attempt to set it on a fully
   equal footing with national languages as a literary medium is to
   court disaster.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Shakespeare, <i>The Tempest</i>.
</p>

<p>
   The truth seems to be about this. As a potential means of
   international communication, Esperanto is unsurpassed, and a long way
   ahead of any national language. As a literary language, it is far
   better than Chinook or Pidgin, far worse than English or Greek.
</p>

<p>
   A language, no more than a man, can serve two masters. By attempting
   to combine within itself this double function an international
   language would cease to attain either object. The reason is simple.
</p>

<p>
   Its legitimate and proper sphere demands of it as the first essential
   that it should be easy and universally accessible. This means that
   the words are to be few, and must have but one clearly marked sense
   each. There are to be no idioms or set phrases, no words that depend
   upon their context or upon allusion for their full sense.
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, among the essentials of a literary language are
   the exact opposites of all these characteristics. The vocabulary
   must be full and plenteous, and there should be a rich variety of
   synonyms; there should be delicate half-tones and <i>nuances</i>;
   the words should be not mere counters or symbols of fixed value,
   determinable in each case by a rapid use of the dictionary alone, but
   must have an atmosphere, a something dependent upon history, usage,
   and allusion, by virtue of which the whole phrase, in the finer
   styles of writing, amounts to more than the sum of the individual
   meanings of the words which it contains, becoming a separate entity
   with an individual flavour of its own. To attempt to create this
   atmosphere in an artificial language is not only futile, but would
   introduce just the difficulties, redundancies, and complications
   which it is its chief object to avoid. Take a single instance,
   Macbeth's&mdash;

<p>
   Here the effect is produced by the contrast between the stately march
   of the long Latin words of thundrous sound, and the short, sharp
   English. A labour-saving language has no business with such words
   as "incarnadine" or "multitudinous." In translating such a passage
   it will reproduce the sense faithfully and clearly, if necessary by
   the combination of simple roots; but the bouquet of the original
   will vanish in the process. This is inevitable, and it is even so
   far an advantage that it removes all ground from the argument that
   a universal language will kill scholarly language-learning. It
   will be just as necessary as ever to read works of fine literature
   in the original, in order to enjoy their full savour; and the
   translation into the common tongue will not prejudice such reading of
   originals more than, or indeed so much as, translations into various
   mother-tongues.
</p>

<p>
   Again, take the whole question of the imitative use of language. In
   national literatures many a passage, poetry or prose, is heightened
   in effect by assonance, alliteration, a certain movement or rhythm of
   phrase. Subtle suggestion slides in sound through the ear and falls
   with mellowing cadence into the heart. Soothed senses murmur their
   own music to the mind; the lullaby lilt of the lay swells full the
   linked sweetness of the song.
</p>

<p>
   The How plays fostering round the What. Down the liquid stream of
   lingual melody the dirge drifts dying&mdash;dying it echoes back into
   a ghostly after-life, as the yet throbbing sense wakes the drowsed
   mind once more. The Swan-song floats double&mdash;song and shadow; and
   in the blend&mdash;half sensuous, half of thought&mdash;man's nature
   tastes fruition.
</p>

<p>
   Now, this verbal artistry, whereby the words set themselves in tune
   to the thoughts, postulates a varied vocabulary, a rich storehouse
   wherein a man may linger and choose among the gems

<!-- 077.png -->

<p>
   But the word-store of an international tongue must not be a golden
   treasury of art, a repository of "bigotry and virtue." On its orderly
   rows of shelves must be immediately accessible the right word for the
   right place: no superfluity, no disorder, no circumambient margin for
   effect. Homocea-like, it "touches the spot," and having deadened the
   ache of incomprehensibility, has done its task. "No flowers."
</p>

<p>
   Naturally some peoples will feel themselves more cramped in a new
   artificial language than others. French, incomparably neat and clear
   within its limits, but possessing the narrowest "margin for effect,"
   is less alien in its genius from Esperanto than is English, with its
   twofold harmony, its potentiality (too rarely exploited) of Romance
   clarity, and its double portion of Germanic vigour and feeling. Yet
   all languages must probably witness the obliteration of some finer
   native shades in the international tongue.
</p>

<p>
   But we must not go to the opposite extreme, and deny to the
   universal language all power of rendering serious thought. Just
   how far it can go, and where its inherent limitations begin, is
   a matter of individual taste and judgment. There are Esperanto
   translations&mdash;and good ones&mdash;of <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>The
   Tempest</i>, <i>Julius Caesar</i>, the <i>Aeneid</i> of Virgil,
   parts of Moli&egrave;re and Homer, besides a goodly variety of other
   literature. These translations do succeed in giving a very fair idea
   of the originals, as any one can test for himself with a little
   trouble, but, as pointed out, they must come something short in
   beauty and variety of expression.
</p>

<p>
   There is even a certain style in Esperanto itself in the hands
   of a good writer, of which the dominant notes are simplicity and
   directness&mdash;two qualities not at all to be despised. Further,

<!-- 078.png -->

<a name="page069"> </a><span class = "pagenum">69</span>
   the unlimited power of word-building and of forming terse compounds
   gives the language an individuality of its own. It contains many
   expressive self-explanatory words whose meaning can only be conveyed
   by a periphrasis in most languages,<sup>1</sup> and this causes it to take on
   the manner and feel of a <i>living</i> tongue, and makes it something
   far more than a mere copy or barren extract of storied speech.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>e.g. <i>samideano</i>&nbsp;= partisan of the same cause or idea.
   <i>vivipova lingvo</i>&nbsp;= language capable of independent
   vigorous existence.
</p>

<p>
   Technically, the fulness of its participial system, rivalled by Greek
   alone, and the absence of all defective verbs, lend to it a very
   great flexibility; and containing, as it does, a variety of specially
   neat devices borrowed from various tongues, it is in a sense neater
   than any of them.
</p>

<p>
   One great test of its capacity for literary expression remains to
   be made. This is an adequate translation of the Bible. A religious
   society, famed for the variety of its translations of the Scriptures
   into every conceivable language, when approached on the subject,
   replied that Esperanto was not a language. But Esperantists will not
   "let it go at that." Besides Dr. Zamenhof's own <i>Predikanto</i>
   (Ecclesiastes), an experiment has been made by two Germans, who
   published a translation of St. Matthew's Gospel. It is not a success,
   and further experiments have just been made by Prof. Macloskie, of
   Princeton, U.S.A., and by E. Metcalfe, M.A. (Oxon), I cannot say with
   what result, not having seen copies.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Cf. also now the "Ordo de Diservo" (special Anglican Church
   service), selected and translated from Prayer Book and Bible for
   use in England by the Rev. J. C. Rust (obtainable from the British
   Esperanto Association, 13, Arundel Street, Strand, price <i>7d.</i>).
</p>

<p>
   From one point of view, the directness and simplicity of the Bible
   would seem to lend themselves to an Esperanto dress; but there are
   certain great difficulties, such as technical expressions, archaic

   for.

<p>
   In the field of rendering scientific literature and current workaday
   prose, whose matter is of more moment than its form, Esperanto has
   already won its spurs. Its perfect lucidity makes it particularly
   suitable for this form of writing.
</p>

<p>
   The conclusion then is, that Esperanto is neither wholly commercial
   nor yet literary in the full sense in which a grown language is
   literary; but it does do what it professes to do, and it is all the
   better for not professing the impossible.

   <div class="subtitolo">
      is an international language a crank's hobby?
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   The apostle of a universal language is made to feel pretty plainly
   that he is regarded as a crank. He may console himself with the usual
   defence that a crank is that which makes revolutions; but for all
   that, it is chilling to be met with a certain smile.
</p>

<p>
   Let us analyse that smile. It varies in intensity, ranging from the
   scathing sneer damnatory to the gentle dimple deprecatory. But in any
   case it belongs to the category of the smile that won't come off.
   I know that grin&mdash;it comes from Cheshire. <!-- gotta love this
   guy's style! -->
</p>

<p>
   What, then, do we mean when we smile at a crank? Firstly and
   generally that we think his ideal impracticable. But it has been
   shown that an international language is not impracticable. This alone
   ought to go far towards removing it from the list of cranks' hobbies.
</p>

<p>
   Secondly, we often mean that the ideal in question is opposed
   to common sense&mdash;e.g. when we smile at a man who lives on
   protein biscuits or walks about without a hat. We do not impugn the
   feasibility of his diet or apparel, but we think he

<!-- 080.png -->

<a name="page071"> </a><span class = "pagenum">71</span>
   is going out of his way to be peculiar without reaping adequate
   advantage by his departure from customary usage.
</p>

<p>
   The test of "crankiness," then, lies in the adequacy of the advantage
   reaped. A man who learns and uses Esperanto may at present depart as
   widely from ordinary usage as a patron of Eustace Miles's restaurant
   or a member of the hatless brigade; but is it true that the advantage
   thereby accruing is equally disputable or matter of opinion? Is it
   not, on the contrary, fairly certain that the use of an auxiliary
   language, if universal, would open up for many regions from which
   exclusion is now felt as a hindrance?
</p>

<p>
   Take the case of a doctor, scientist, scholar, researcher in any
   branch of knowledge, who desires to keep abreast of the advance of
   knowledge in his particular line. He may have to wait for years
   before a translation of some work he wishes to read is published in
   a tongue he knows, and in any case all the periodical literature of
   every nation, except the one or two whose languages he may learn,
   will be closed to him. The output of learned work is increasing
   very fast in all civilized countries, and therefore results are
   recorded in an increasing number of languages in monographs, reports,
   transactions, and the specialist press. A move is being made in the
   right direction by the proposal to print the publications of the
   Brussels International Bibliographical Institute in Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   Take a few examples of the hampering effect upon scholarly work
   of the language difficulty as it already exists. The diffusion of
   learning will, ironically enough, increase the difficulty.<sup>1</sup> The
   late Prof. Todhunter, of Cambridge, was driven to learning Russian
   for mathematical purposes. He managed to learn enough to enable
   him to read mathematical treatises; but how many mathematicians or
   scientists (or classical scholars, for that matter) could do as much?
   And of how much profit was the learning of Russian, <i>qu&acirc;</i>
   Russian, to Prof. Todhunter? It only took up time which could have
   been better spent, as there cannot be anything very uplifting or
   cultivating in the language of mathematical Russian.

<p>
   Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposed that all serious scientific
   work should be published in one of the six languages
   following&mdash;English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin.
   But why should other nations have to produce in these languages?
   and why should serious students have to be prepared to read six
   languages?
</p>

<p>
   All this was many years ago. The balance of culture has since then
   been gradually but steadily shifting in favour of other peoples.
   The present writer had occasion to make a special study of Byron's
   influence on the Continent. It turned out that one of the biggest and
   most important works upon the subject was written in Polish. It has
   therefore remained inaccessible. This is only an illustration of a
   difficulty that faces many workers.
</p>

<p>
   Thirdly, there is a good large portion of the British public that
   regards as a crank anything not British or that does not benefit
   themselves personally. It really <i>is</i> hard for an Englishman,
   Frenchman, or German, brought up among a homogeneous people of old
   civilization, to realize the extent of the incubus under which the
   smaller nations of Europe and the polyglot empires further east are
   groaning. Imagine yourself an educated Swiss, Dutchman, or a member
   of any of the thirty or forty nationalities that make up the Austrian
   or Russian Empires. How would you like to have to learn three or
   four foreign languages for practical purposes before you could hope
   to take much of a position in life? Can any one assert that the kind
   of grind required, with its heavy taxation of the memory, is in most
   cases really educative or confers culture?
</p>

<p>
   Think it out. What do you really mean when you jeer at an

<p>
   Though the idea of an artificially constructed language to meet the
   needs of speakers of various tongues seems for some reason to contain
   something absurd or repellent to the mind of Western Europeans, there
   have, as a matter of fact, been various attempts made at different
   times and places to overcome the obvious difficulty in the obvious
   way; and all have met with a large measure of success.
</p>

<p>
   The usual method of procedure has been quite rough and ready.
   Words or forms have been taken from a variety of languages, and
   simply mixed up together, without any scientific attempt at
   co-ordination or simplification. The resulting international
   languages have varied in their degree of artificiality, and in the
   proportions in which they were consciously or semi-consciously
   compiled, or else adopted their elements ready-made, without
   conscious adaptation, from existing tongues. But their production,
   widespread and continuous use, and great practical utility, showed
   that they arose in response to a felt want. The wonder is that the
   world should have grown so old without supplying this want in a more
   systematic way.
</p>

<p>
   Every one has heard of the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Levant. In

<!-- 084.png -->

<a name="page075"> </a><span class = "pagenum">75</span>
   India the master-language that carries a man through among
   a hundred different tribes is Hindustanee, or Urdu. At the outset
   it represented a new need of an imperial race. It had its origin
   during the latter half of the sixteenth century under Akbar, and
   was born of the sudden extension of conquest and affairs brought
   about by the great ruler. Round him gathered a cosmopolitan crowd of
   courtiers, soldiers, vassal princes, and followers of all kinds, and
   wider dealings than the ordinary local petty affairs received a great
   stimulus. Urdu is a good example of a mix-up language, with a
   pure Aryan framework developed out of a dialect of the old Hindi. In
   fact, it is to India very much what Esperanto might be to Europe,
   only it is more empirical, and not so consciously and scientifically
   worked out.
</p>

<p>
   Somewhat analogous to Urdu, in that it is a literary language
   used by the educated classes for intercommunication throughout a
   polygot empire, is the Mandarin Chinese. If China is not "polygot"
   in the strict technical sense of the term, she is so in fact,
   since the dialects used in different provinces are mutually
   incomprehensible for the speakers of them. Mandarin is the official
   master-language.
</p>

<p>
   Rather of the nature of <i>patois</i> are Pidgin-English, Chinook,
   and Benguela, the language used throughout the tribes of the Congo.
   Yet business of great importance and involving large sums of money
   is, or has been, transacted in them, and they are used over a wide
   area.
</p>

<p>
   Pidgin consists of a medley of words, largely English, but with a
   considerable admixture from other tongues, combined in the framework
   of Chinese construction. It is current in ports all over the East,
   and is by no means confined to China. The principle is that roots,
   chiefly monosyllabic, are used in their crude form without inflection
   or agglutination, the mere juxtaposition (without any change of form)
   showing whether they are verbs, adjectives, etc. This is the Chinese
   contribution to the language.
</p>

<p>
   Chinook is the key-language to dealings with the huge number

<!-- 085.png -->

<a name="page076"> </a><span class = "pagenum">76</span>
   of different tribes of American Indians. It contains a large
   admixture of French words, and was to a great extent artificially put
   together by the Hudson Bay Company's officials, for the purposes of
   their business.
</p>

<p>
   Quite apart from these various more or less consciously constructed
   mixed languages, there is a much larger artificial element in many
   national languages than is commonly realized. Take modern Hungarian,
   Greek, or even Italian. Literary Italian, as we know it, is largely
   an artificial construction for literary purposes, made by Dante and
   others, on the basis of a vigorous and naturally supple dialect. With
   modern Greek this is even more strikingly the case. As a national
   language it is almost purely the work of a few scholars, who in
   modern times arbitrarily and artificially revived and modified the
   ancient Greek.
</p>

<p>
   There seems, then, to be absolutely no foundation in experience for
   opposing a universal language on the score of artificiality.

   List of Schemes proposed
</p>

<p>
   The story of Babel in the Old Testament reflects the popular feeling
   that confusion of tongues is a hindrance and a curse. Similarly in
   the New Testament the Pentecostal gift of tongues is a direct gift
   of God. But apparently it was not till about 300 years ago that
   philosophers began to think seriously about a world-language.
</p>

<p>
   The earliest attempts were based upon the mediaeval idea that man
   might attain to a perfect knowledge of the universe. The whole sum of
   things might, it was thought, be brought by division and subdivision
   within an orderly scheme of classification. To

<!-- 086.png -->

<a name="page077"> </a><span class = "pagenum">77</span>
   any conceivable idea or thing capable of being represented by human
   speech might therefore be attached a corresponding word, like a
   label, on a perfectly regular and logical system. Words would thus
   be self-explanatory to any person who had grasped the system,
   and would serve as an index or key to the things they represented.
   Language thus became a branch of philosophy as the men of the time
   conceived it, or at all events a useful handmaid. Thus arose the idea
   of a "philosophical language."
</p>

<p>
   A very simple illustration will serve to show what is meant. Go into
   a big library and look up any work in the catalogue. You will find a
   reference number&mdash;say, 04582.g. 35,c. If you learnt the system of
   classification of that library, the reference number would explain to
   you where to find that particular book out of any number of millions.
   The fact of the number beginning with a "0" would at once place the
   book in a certain main division, and so on with the other numbers,
   till "g" in that series gave you a fairly small subdivision. Within
   that, "35" gives you the number of the case, and "c" the shelf within
   the case. The book is soon run to earth.
</p>

<p>
   Just so a word in a philosophical language. Suppose the word
   is <i>brabo</i>. The final <i>o</i> shows it to be a noun. The
   monosyllabic root shows it to be concrete. The initial <i>b</i>
   shows it to be in the animal category. The subsequent letters give
   subdivisions of the animal kingdom, till the word is narrowed down
   by its form to membership of one small class of animals. The other
   members of the class will be denoted by an ordered sequence of words
   in which only the letter denoting the individual is changed. Thus,
   if <i>brabo</i> means "dog," <i>braco</i> may be "cat," and so on:
   <i>brado</i>, <i>brafo</i>, <i>brago</i>... etc., according to
   the classification set up.
</p>

<p>
   Words, then, are reduced to mere formulae; and grammar, inflections,
   etc., are similarly laid out on purely logical, systematic lines,
   without taking any account of existing languages and their structure.
   To languages of this type the historians of the universal language
   have given the name of <i>a priori</i> languages.
</p>

<!-- 087.png -->

<a name="page078"> </a><span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<p>
   Directly opposed to these is the other group of artificial languages,
   called <i>a posteriori</i>. These are wholly based on the principle
   of borrowing from existing language: their artificiality consists
   in choice of words and in regularization and simplification of
   vocabulary and grammar. They avoid, as far as possible, any elements
   of arbitrary invention, and confine themselves to adapting and making
   easier what usage has already sanctioned.
</p>

<p>
   Between the two main types come the <i>mixed languages</i>, partaking
   of the nature of each.
</p>

<p id="languagelist">
   The following list is taken from the <i>Histoire de la langue
   universelle</i>, by MM. Couturat and Leau:
</p>

<p align="center" class="majusklete" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em">
   I. A Priori Languages
</p>

<p>
   1. The philosopher Descartes, in a letter of 1629, forecasts a system
   (realized in our days by Zamenhof) of a regular universal grammar:
   words to be formed with fixed roots and affixes, and to be in every
   case immediately decipherable from the dictionary alone. He rejects
   this scheme as fit "for vulgar minds," and proceeds to sketch the
   outline of all subsequent "philosophic" languages. Thus the great
   thinker anticipates both types of universal language.
</p>

<p>
   2. Sir Thomas Urquhart, 1653&mdash;<i>Logopandekteision</i> (see
   <a href="#partIIchapterIII">next chapter</a>).
</p>

<p>
   3. Dalgarno, 1661&mdash;<i>Ars Signorum</i>.
   <br/>
   Dalgarno was a Scotchman born at Aberdeen in 1626. His language is
   founded on the classification of ideas. Of these there are seventeen
   main classes, represented by seventeen letters. Each letter is the
   initial of all the words in its class.
</p>

<p>
   4. Wilkins, 1668&mdash;<i>An Essay towards a Real Character and a
   Philosophical Language</i>.
   <br/>
   Wilkins was Bishop of Chester, and first secretary and one of the
   founders of the Royal Society. Present members please note. His
   system is a development of Dalgarno's.
</p>

<!-- 088.png -->

<a name="page079"> </a><span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<p>
   5. Leibnitz, 1646&ndash;1716.
   <br/>
   Leibnitz thought over this matter all his life, and there are various
   passages on it scattered through his works, though no one treatise
   is devoted to it. He held that the systems of his predecessors were
   not philosophical enough. He dreamed of a logic of thought applicable
   to all ideas. All complex ideas are compounds of simple ideas, as
   non-primary numbers are of primary numbers. Numbers can be compounded
   <i>ad infinitum.</i> So if numbers are translated into pronouncible
   words, these words can be combined so as to represent every possible
   idea.
</p>

<p>
   6. Delormel, 1795 (An III)&mdash;<i>Projet d'une langue
   universelle</i>.
   <br/>
   Delormel was inspired by the humanitarian ideas of the French
   Revolution. He wished to bring mankind together in fraternity. His
   system rests on a logical classification of ideas on a decimal basis.
</p>

<p>
   7. Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Sudre, 1817&mdash;<i>Langue musicale universelle</i>.
   <br/>
   Sudre was a schoolmaster, born in 1787. His language is founded on
   the seven notes of the scale, and he calls it Solresol.
</p>

<p>
   8. Grosselin, 1836&mdash;<i>Systeme de langue universelle</i>.
   <br/>
   A language composed of 1500 words, called "roots," with 100 suffixes,
   or modifying terminations.
</p>

<p>
   9. Vidal, 1844&mdash;<i>Langue universelle et analytique</i>.
   <br/>
   A curious combination of letters and numbers.
</p>

<p>
   10. Letellier, 1852&ndash;1855&mdash;<i>Cours complet de langue
   universelle</i>, and many subsequent publications.
   <br/>
   Letellier was a former schoolmaster and school inspector. His system
   is founded on the "theory of language," which is that the word ought
   to represent by its component letters an analysis of the idea it
   conveys.
</p>

<p>
   11. Abb&eacute; Bonifacio Sotos Ochando, 1852, Madrid.
   <br/>
   The abb&eacute; had been a deputy to the Spanish Cortes, Spanish

<!-- 089.png -->

<a name="page080"> </a><span class = "pagenum">80</span>
   master to Louis Philippe's children, a university professor, and
   director of a polytechnic college in Madrid, etc. His language is a
   logical one, intended for international scientific use, and chiefly
   for writing. He does not think a spoken language for all purposes
   possible.
</p>

<p>
   12. <i>Societ&eacute; Internationale de linguistique</i>. First
   report dated 1856.
   <br/>
   The object of the society was to carry out a radical reform
   of French orthography, and to prepare the way for a universal
   language&mdash;"the need of which is beginning to be generally felt."
   In the report the idea of adopting one of the most widely spoken
   national languages is considered and rejected. The previous projects
   are reviewed, and that of Sotos Ochando is recommended as the best.
   The <i>a posteriori</i> principle is rejected and the <i>a priori</i>
   deliberately adopted. This is excusable, owing to the fact that most
   projects hitherto had been <i>a priori</i>. The philosopher Charles
   Renouvier gave proof of remarkable prescience by condemning the <i>a
   priori</i> theory in an article in <i>La Revue</i>, 1855, in which he
   forecasts the <i>a posteriori</i> plan.

   II. Mixed Languages
</p>

<p>
   These are chiefly Volap&uuml;k and its derivates.
</p>

<p>
   1. August Theodor von Grimm, state councillor of the Russian Empire,
   worked out a "programme for the formation of a universal language,"
   which contains some <i>a priori</i> elements, as well as nearly
   all the principles which subsequent authors of <i>a posteriori</i>

   III. A Posteriori Languages
</p>

   1. Faiguet, 1765&mdash;<i>Langue nouvelle</i>.
   <br/>
   Faiguet was treasurer of France. He published his project, which is
   a scheme for simplifying grammar, in the famous eighteenth-century
   encyclopaedia of Diderot and d'Alembert.
</p>

<p>
   2. Schipfer, 1839&mdash;<i>Communicationssprache</i>.
   <br/>
   This scheme has an historical interest for two reasons. First, the
   fact that it is founded on French reflects the feeling of the time
   that French was, as he says, "already to a certain extent a universal
   language." The point of interest is to compare the date when the
   projects began to be founded on English. In 1879 Volap&uuml;k took
   English for the base. Secondly, Schipfer's scheme reflects the new
   consciousness of wider possibilities that were coming into the world
   with the development of means of communication by rail and steamboat.
   The author recommends the utility of his project by referring to "the
   new way of travelling."

   3. De Rudelle, 1858&mdash;<i>Pantos-Dimon-Glossa.</i>
   <br/>
   De Rudelle was a modern-language master in France and afterwards
   at the London Polytechnic. His language is based on ten natural
   languages, especially Greek, Latin, and the modern derivatives of
   Latin, with grammatical hints from English, German, and Russian. It
   is remarkable for having been the first to embody several principles
   of the first importance, which have since been more fully carried
   out in other schemes, and are now seen to be indispensable. Among
   these are: (1) distinction of the parts of speech by a fixed form for
   each; (2) suppression of separate verbal forms for each person; (3)
   formation of derivatives by means of suffixes with fixed meanings.

   8. Courtonne, 1885&mdash;<i>Langue Internationale

   <br/>
   Based on the modern Romance languages, and therefore not sufficiently
   international. A peculiarity is that all roots are monosyllabic. The
   history of this attempt illustrates the weight of inertia against
   which any such project has to struggle. It was presented to the
   Scientific Society of Nice, which drew up a report and sent it to all
   the learned societies of Romance-speaking countries. Answers were
   received from three towns&mdash;Pau, Sens, and Nimes. It was then
   proposed to convene an international neo-Latin congress; but it is
   not surprising to hear that nothing came of it.

<p>
   9. Steiner, 1885&mdash;<i>Pasilingua</i>.

   A counterblast to Volap&uuml;k. The author aims at copying the

   <i>lingua franca</i> or Pidgin-English. Based on English, French, and
   German; but the English vocabulary forms the groundwork.

   adjectives, three; pronouns, one; verbal roots, one syllable

   III
   <div class="subtitolo">
      the earliest british attempt
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   A perusal of the foregoing list shows that in the early days of
   the search for an international language the British were well to
   the fore. Of the British pioneers in this field the first two were
   Scots&mdash;a fact which accords well with the traditional enterprise
   north of the Tweed, and readiness to look abroad, beyond their own
   noses, or, in this case, beyond their own tongues. It is likewise
   remarkable that the British have almost dropped out of the running
   in recent times, as far as origination is concerned. Is this fact
   also typical, a small symptom of Jeshurun's general fatness? Does it
   reflect a lesser degree of nimbleness in moving with the spirit of
   the times?
</p>

<p>
   Anyhow, in this case the Briton's content with what he has got at
   home is well grounded. He certainly possesses a first-class language.
   As a curious example of the quaint use of it by a scholar and clever
   man in the middle of the seventeenth century, the following account
   of Sir Thomas Urquhart's book may be of some interest.
</p>

<p>
   Sir Thomas is well known as the translator of Rabelais; and evidently
   something of the curious erudition, polyglotism, and quaintness of
   conceit of his author stuck to the translator. This book is the
   rarest of his tracts, all of which are uncommon, and has been hardly
   more than mentioned by name by the previous writers on the subject.

   In a note at the end of the book he apologizes for haste, saying that
   the copy was "given out to two several printers, one alone not being
   fully able to hold his quill a-going."
</p>

<p>
   The book opens with:
</p>

<p align="center">
   "The Epistle Dedicatory to Nobody."
</p>

<p>
   The first paragraph runs:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="majusklete dekstrakomence">"Most Honourable,</p>

   <p class="duobledekstrakomence">
      "My non-supponent Lord, and Soveraign Master of contradictions
      in adjected terms, that unto you I have presumed to tender
      the dedicacie of this introduction, will not seem strange to
      those, that know how your concurrence did further me to the
      accomplishment of that new Language, into the frontispiece whereof
      it is permitted."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   After some preliminary remarks, he says:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "Now to the end the Reader may be more enamoured of the Language,
      wherein I am to publish a grammar and lexicon,

<!-- 098.png -->

<a name="page089"> </a><span class = "pagenum">89</span>
      I will here set down some few qualities and advantages peculiar to
      itself, and which no Language else (although all other concurred
      with it) is able to reach unto."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   There follow sixty-six "qualities and advantages," which contain
   the only definite information about the language, for the promised
   grammar and lexicon never appeared. A few may be quoted as typical of
   the inducements held out to "pregnant and ingenious spirits," to the
   end they "may be more enamoured of the Language." The good Sir Thomas
   was plainly an optimist.
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Sixthly, in the cases of all the
      declinable parts of speech, it surpasseth all other languages
      whatsoever: for whilst others have but five or six at most, it hath
      ten, besides the nominative.
   </p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Eighthly, every word capable of number is
      better provided therewith in this language, then [<i>sic</i>] by any
      other: for instead of two or three numbers which others have, this
      affordeth you four; to wit, the singular, dual, plural, and redual.
   </p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Tenthly, in this tongue there are eleven
      genders; wherein likewise it exceedeth all other languages.
   </p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Eleventhly, Verbs, Mongrels, Participles,
      and Hybrids have all of them ten tenses, besides the present: which
      number no language else is able to attain to.
   </p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Thirteenthly, in lieu of six moods,
      which other languages have at most, this one enjoyeth seven in its
      conjugable words."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   Sir Thomas evidently believed in giving his clients plenty for
   their money. He is lavish of "Verbs, Mongrels, Participles, and
   Hybrids," truly a tempting menagerie. He promises, however, a
   time-reduction on learning a quantity:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Seven and fiftiethly, the greatest
      wonder of all is that of all the languages in the world it is
      easiest to learn; a boy of ten years old being able to attain to the
      knowledge thereof in three months' space; because there are in it
      many facilitations for the memory, which no other language hath but
      itself."
   </p>

</div>

<!-- 099.png -->

<a name="page090"> </a><span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<p>
   Seventeenth-century boys of tender years must have had a good
   stomach for "Mongrels and Hybrids," and such-like dainties
   of the grammatical <i>menu</i>; but even if they could swallow a
   mongrel, it is hard to believe that they would not have strained at
   ten cases in three months. It might be called "casual labour," but it
   would certainly have been "three months' hard."
</p>

<p>
   After these examples of grammatical generosity, it is not surprising
   to read:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Fifteenthly, in this language the Verbs
      and Participles have four voices, although it was never heard that
      ever any other language had above three."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   Note that the former colleagues of the "Verbs and Participles,"
   the "Mongrels and Hybrids," are here dropped out of the category.
   Perhaps it is as well, seeing the number of voices attributed to
   each. A four-voiced mongrel would have gone one better than
   the triple-headed hell-hound Cerberus, and created quite
   a special Hades of its own for schoolboys, to say nothing of light
   sleepers.
</p>

<p>
   Under "five and twentiethly" we learn that "there is no Hexameter,
   Elegiack, Saphick, Asclepiad, lambick, or any other kind of Latin or
   Greek verse, but I will afford you another in this language of the
   same sort"; which leads up to:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Six and twentiethly, as it trotteth
      easily with metrical feet, so at the end of the career of each
      line, hath it dexterity, after the manner of our English and other
      vernaculary tongues, to stop with the closure of a rhyme; in the
      framing whereof, the well-versed in that language shall have
      so little labour, that for every word therein he shall be able to
      furnish at least five hundred several monosyllables of the same
      termination with it."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   A remarkable opportunity for every man to become his own poet!
</p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Four and thirtiethly, in this language
      also words expressive of herbs represent unto us with what degree of
      cold, moisture, heat, or dryness they are qualified, together with
      some other property distinguishing them from other herbs."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   In this crops out the idea that haunted the minds of mediaeval
   speculators on the subject: that language could play a more important
   part than it had hitherto done; that a word, while conveying an
   idea, could at the same time in some way describe or symbolize the
   attributes of the thing named. Imagine the charge of thought that
   could be rammed into a phrase in such a language. Imagine too, you
   who remember the cold shudder of your childhood, when you heard the
   elders discussing a prospective dose&mdash;intensified by all the
   horrors of imagination when the discussion was veiled in the "decent
   obscurity" of French&mdash;imagine the grim realism of a language
   containing "<i>words expressive of herbs</i>",&mdash;and expressive to
   that extent!
</p>

<p>
   There seems, indeed, to have been something rather cold-blooded
   about this language:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Eight and thirtiethly, in the contexture
      of nouns, pronouns, and preposital articles united together, it
      administreth many wonderful varieties of Laconick expressions, as in
      the Grammar thereof shall more at large be made known unto you."
   </p>

</div>

<p>
   But, after all, it had a human side:
</p>

<div class="letero">

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Three and fourtiethly, as its
      interjections are more numerous, so are they more emphatical in their
      respective expression of passions, than that part of speech is in any
      other language whatsoever.
   </p>

   <p class="dekstrakomence">
      "...&nbsp;Eight and fourtiethly, of all languages
      this is the most compendious in complement, and consequently fittest
      for Courtiers and Ladies."
   </p>

<p>
   Sir Thomas seems to have been a bit of a man of the world too.

   This "therefore," with its direct deduction from "conciseness of

<p>
   Volap&uuml;k is the invention of a "white night." Those who know
   their <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> will perhaps involuntarily
   conjure up the picture of the kindly and fantastic White Knight,
   riding about on a horse covered with mousetraps and other strange
   caparisons, which he introduced to all and sundry with the unfailing
   remark, "It's my own invention." Scoffers will not be slow to
   find in Volap&uuml;k and the White Knight's inventions a common
   characteristic&mdash;their fantasticness. Perhaps there really is
   some analogy in the fact that both inventors had to mount their
   hobby-horses and ride errant through sundry lands, thrusting their
   creations on an unwilling world. But the particular kind of white
   night of which Volap&uuml;k was born is the

<!-- 102.png -->

<a name="page093"> </a><span class = "pagenum">93</span>
   <i>nuit blanche</i>, literally = "white night," but idiomatically =
   "night of insomnia."
</p>

<p>
   On the night of March 31, 1879, the good Roman Catholic Bishop
   Schleyer, cur&eacute; of Litzelstetten, near Constance, could not get
   to sleep. From his over-active brain, charged with a knowledge of
   more than fifty languages, sprang the world-speech, as Athene sprang
   fully armed from the brain of Zeus. At any rate, this is the legend
   of the origin of Volap&uuml;k.
</p>

<p>
   As for the name, an Englishman will hardly appreciate the fact that
   the word "Volap&uuml;k" is derived from the two English words "world"
   and "speech." This transformation of "world" into <i>vol</i> and
   "speech" into <i>p&uuml;k</i> is a good illustration of the manner
   in which Volap&uuml;k is based on English, and suggests at once a
   criticism of that all-important point in an artificial language, the
   vocabulary. It is too arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
   Published in 1880, Volap&uuml;k spread first in South Germany,
   and then in France, where its chief apostle was M. Kerckhoffs,
   modern-language master in the principal school of commerce in Paris.
   He founded a society for its propagation, which soon numbered among
   its members several well-known men of science and letters. The great
   Magasins du Printemps&mdash;a sort of French Whiteley's, and familiar
   to all who have shopped in Paris&mdash;started a class, attended by
   over a hundred of its employees; and altogether fourteen different
   classes were opened in Paris, and the pupils were of a good stamp.
</p>

<p>
   Progress was extraordinarily rapid in other European countries, and
   by 1889, only nine years after the publication of Volap&uuml;k, there
   were 283 Volap&uuml;k societies, distributed throughout Europe,
   America, and the British Colonies. Instruction books were published
   in twenty-five languages, including Volap&uuml;k itself; numerous
   newspapers, in and about Volap&uuml;k, sprang up all over the world;
   the number of Volap&uuml;kists was estimated at a million. This
   extraordinarily rapid success is very striking, and seems to afford
   proof that there is a widely felt want for an international language.
   Three Volap&uuml;k congresses were held,

<!-- 103.png -->

<a name="page094"> </a><span class = "pagenum">94</span>
   of which the third, held in Paris in 1889, with proceedings entirely
   in Volap&uuml;k, was the most important.
</p>

<p>
   The rapid decline of Volap&uuml;k is even more instructive than its
   sensational rise. The congress of Paris marked its zenith: hopes ran
   high, and success seemed assured. Within two years it was practically
   dead. No more congresses were held, the partisans dwindled away, the
   local clubs dissolved, the newspapers failed, and the whole movement
   came to an end. There only remained a new academy founded by Bishop
   Schleyer, and here and there a group of the faithful.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>A Volap&uuml;k journal still appears in Graz,
   Stiria&mdash;<i>Volap&uuml;kabled lezenodik</i>. The editor has
   just (March 1907) retired, and the veteran Bishop Schleyer, now
   seventy-five years old, is taking up the editorship again.
</p>

<p>
   The chief reason of this failure was internal dissension. First
   arose the question of principle: Should Volap&uuml;k aim at being
   a literary language, capable of expressing all the finer shades of
   thought and feeling? or should it confine itself to being a practical
   means of business communication?
</p>

<p>
   Bishop Schleyer claimed for his invention an equal rank among the
   literary languages of the world. The practical party, headed by M.
   Kerckhoffs, wished to keep it utilitarian and practical. With the
   object of increasing its utility, they proposed certain changes in
   the language; and thus there arose, in the second place, differences
   of opinion as to fundamental points of structure, such as the
   nature and origin of the roots to be adopted. Vital questions were
   thus reopened, and the whole language was thrown back into the
   melting-pot.
</p>

<p>
   The first congress was held at Friedrichshafen in August 1884, and
   was attended almost exclusively by Germans. The second congress,
   Munich, August 1887, brought together over 200 Volap&uuml;kists from
   different countries. A professor of geology from Halle University was
   elected president, and an International Academy of Volap&uuml;k was
   founded.
</p>

<p>
   Then the trouble began. M. Kerckhoffs was unanimously elected
   director of the academy, and Bishop Schleyer was made

<!-- 104.png -->

<a name="page095"> </a><span class = "pagenum">95</span>
   grand-master (<i>cifal</i>) for life. Questions arose as to the
   duties of the academy and the respective powers of the inventor
   of the language and the academicians. M. Kerckhoffs was all along
   the guiding spirit on the side of the academy. He was in the main
   supported by the Volap&uuml;k world, though there seems to have been
   some tendency, at any rate at first, on the part of the Germans to
   back the bishop. It is impossible to go into details of the points at
   issue. Suffice it to say, that eventually the director of the academy
   carried a resolution giving the inventor three votes to every one of
   ordinary members in all academy divisions, but refusing him the right
   of veto, which he claimed. The bishop replied by a threat to depose
   M. Kerckhoffs from the directorship, which of course he could not
   make good. The constitution of the academy was only binding inasmuch
   as it had been drawn up and adopted by the constituent members, and
   it gave no such powers to the inventor.
</p>

<p>
   So here was a very pretty quarrel as to the ownership of
   Volap&uuml;k. The bishop said it belonged to him, as he had invented
   it: he was its father. The academy said it belonged to the public,
   who had a right to amend it in the common interest. This child, which
   had newly opened its eyes and smiled upon the world, and upon which
   the world was then smiling back&mdash;was it a son domiciled in its
   father's house and fully <i>in patria potestate</i>? or a ward in
   the guardianship of its chief promoters? or an orphan foundling, to
   be boarded out on the scattered-home system at the public expense,
   and to be brought up to be useful to the community at large? A
   vexed question of paternity; and the worst of it was, there was no
   international court competent to try the case.
</p>

<p>
   Meantime the congress of 1889 at Paris came on. Volap&uuml;k was
   booming everywhere. Left to itself, it flourished like a green
   bay-tree. This meeting was to set an official seal upon its success;
   and governments, convinced by this thing done openly in the <i>ville
   lumi&egrave;re</i>, would accept the <i>fait accompli</i> and
   introduce it into their schools.
</p>

<!-- 105.png -->

<a name="page096"> </a><span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<p>
   Thirteen countries sent representatives, including Turkey and China.
   The great Kerckhoffs was elected president. The proceedings were
   in Volap&uuml;k. The foundling's future was canvassed in terms of
   himself by a cosmopolitan board of guardians, who did not yet know
   what he was. Rather a Gilbertian situation. Trying a higher flight,
   we may say, in Platonic phrase, that Volap&uuml;k seemed to be about
   midway between being and not-being. It is a far cry from Gilbert
   <i>vi&acirc;</i> Plato to Mr. Kipling, but perhaps Volap&uuml;k, at
   this juncture, may be most aptly described as a "sort of a giddy
   harumphrodite," if not "a devil an' a ostrich an' a orphan-child in
   one."
</p>

<p>
   Business done: The congress discusses.
</p>

<p>
   The congress passed a resolution that there should be drawn up
   "a simple normal grammar, from which all useless rules should be
   excluded," and proceeded to adopt a final constitution for the
   Volap&uuml;k Academy.
</p>

<p>
   Article 15 says: "The decisions of the academy must be at once
   submitted to the inventor. If the inventor has not within thirty
   days protested against the decisions, they are valid. Decisions not
   approved by the inventor are referred back to the academy, and are
   valid if carried by a two-thirds majority."
</p>

<p>
   The bishop held out for his right of absolute veto, as his episcopal
   fellows and their colleagues are doing "in another place" in England.
   The conflict presents some analogy with other graver constitutional
   matters, involving discussion of the respective merits of absolute
   and suspensive veto, and may therefore have some interest at present,
   apart from its great importance in any scheme for an international
   language.
</p>

<p>
   The upshot was that dissensions broke out within the academy. The
   director, unable to carry a complete scheme of reformed grammar,
   resigned (1891), and the academy, whose business it was to arrange
   the next congress and keep the movement going, never convened a
   fourth congress. Several academicians set to work on new artificial
   languages of their own; and what was left of

<!-- 106.png -->

<a name="page097"> </a><span class = "pagenum">97</span>
   the Academy of Volap&uuml;k, under a new director, M. Rosenberger, a
   St. Petersburg railway engineer, elected 1893, subsequently turned
   its attention to working out a new language, to which was given the
   name Idiom Neutral (see <a href="#partIIchapterV">next chapter</a>).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
   It is interesting to note that, when Volap&uuml;k was nearing its
   high-water mark, the American Philosophical Society appointed a
   committee (October 1887) to inquire into its scientific value.
</p>

<p>
   This committee reported in November 1887. The report states that
   the creation of an international language is in conformity with
   the general tendency of modern civilization, and is not merely
   desirable, but "<i>will certainly be realized</i>." It goes on to
   reject Volap&uuml;k as the solution of the problem, as being on the
   whole retrogade in tendency. It is too arbitrary in construction, and
   not international enough in vocabulary; nor does it correspond to
   the general trend of development of language, which is away from a
   synthetic grammar (inflection by means of terminations, as in Latin
   and Greek) and towards an analytic one (inflection by termination
   replaced by prepositions and auxiliaries).
</p>

<p>
   But the committee was so fully convinced of the importance of an
   international language, that it proposed to the Philosophical Society
   that it should invite all the learned societies of the world to
   co-operate in the production of a universal language. A resolution
   embodying this recommendation was adopted by the society, and the
   invitations were sent out. About twenty societies accepted&mdash;among
   them the University of Edinburgh. The Scots again!
</p>

<p>
   The London Philological Society commissioned Mr. Ellis to investigate
   the subject, and upon his report declined to co-operate. Mr. Ellis
   was a believer in Volap&uuml;k, and furthermore did not agree with
   the American Philosophical Society's conclusion that an international
   language ought to be founded on an Indo-Germanic (Aryan) basis. In
   this Mr. Ellis was almost certainly wrong, as subsequent experience
   is tending to show. The Japanese, among others, are taking up
   Esperanto with enthusiasm,

<!-- 107.png -->

<a name="page098"> </a><span class = "pagenum">98</span>
   find it easy, and make no difficulty about its Aryan basis. But,
   apart from linguistic considerations, Mr. Ellis's practical reasoning
   was certainly sound. It was to this effect: The main thing is
   to adopt a language that is already in wide use and shown to be
   adequate. Alterations bring dissension; by sticking to what we have
   already got, imperfections and all, strife is avoided, and the thing
   is at once reduced to practice.
</p>

<p>
   This was a wise counsel, and applies to-day with double force to the
   present holder of the field, Esperanto, which is besides, in the
   opinion of experts, a better language than Volap&uuml;k, and far
   easier to acquire.
</p>

<p>
   However, on the question of technical merits, the American
   Philosophical Society was probably right, as against the London
   Philological Society represented by Mr. Ellis. And the proof is that
   Volap&uuml;k died&mdash;primarily, indeed, of dissensions among its
   partisans, but of dissensions superinduced on inherent defects of
   principle. That this is true may be seen from the subsequent history
   of the Volap&uuml;k movement. This is briefly narrated in the next
   chapter, under the name of Idiom Neutral.

<p>
   We saw above that M. Kerckhoffs was succeeded in the directorship of
   the Volap&uuml;k Academy, 1893, by M. Rosenberger, of St. Petersburg.
   During his term of office the academy continued its work of amending
   and improving the language. The method of procedure was as follows:
   The director elaborated proposals, which he embodied in circulars and
   sent round from time to time to his fellow-academicians. They voted
   "Yes" or "No," so that the language, when finished, was approved by
   them all, and was the joint product of the academy; but it was, in
   its new form, to a great extent, the work of the director. At the end
   of his term

<!-- 108.png -->

<a name="page099"> </a><span class = "pagenum">99</span>
   of office it was practically complete. It had undergone a complete
   transformation, and was now called Idiom Neutral.
</p>

<p>
   In 1898 M. Rosenberger was succeeded by Rev. A.F. Holmes, of Macedon,
   New York State. The members of the academy vary from time to time,
   and include (or have included since 1898) natives of America,
   Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and
   Russia.
</p>

<p>
   Dictionaries of Idiom Neutral have been published in English (in
   America), German, and Dutch; but the language hardly seems to
   be in use except among the members of the academy. These do not
   meet, but carry on their business by means of circulars, drawn
   up, of course, in Neutral. There are at present only four groups
   of Neutralists&mdash;those of St. Petersburg, Nuremberg, Brussels,
   and San Antonio, Texas. The famous linguistic club of Nuremberg is
   remarkable for having gone through the evolution from Volap&uuml;k to
   Idiom Neutral <i>vi&acirc;</i> Esperanto! Besides these four groups,
   there are isolated Neutralists in certain towns in Great Britain. The
   academy seems still to have some points to settle, and the work of
   propaganda has hardly yet begun.
</p>

<p>
   A paper published in Brussels, under the name of <i>Idei
   International</i>, seems to represent the ideas of scattered
   Neutralists, and of some partisans of other schemes based on
   Romance vocabulary. These languages resemble each other greatly,
   and some sanguine spirits dream that they may be fused together
   into the ultimate international language. A few even hope for an
   amalgamation with Esperanto, through the medium of a reformed type
   of Esperanto, which approximates more nearly to these newer schemes,
   its vocabulary being, like theirs, almost entirely Romance. A series
   of modifications was published tentatively by Dr. Zamenhof himself in
   1894, but was suppressed from practical considerations, having regard
   to the fate that overtook Volap&uuml;k, when once it fell into the
   hands of reformers. The so-called reforms never represented the
   real ideas of Zamenhof, and were rather in the nature of reluctant
   concessions to the weaker brethren. They were never introduced.

   The reader may be interested to compare for himself specimens of
   Volap&uuml;k, Idiom Neutral (its lineal descendant), and Esperanto.
   This Esperanto is the only one in use, most Esperantists having never
   even heard of the reform project, which was at once dropped, before
   the language had entered upon its present cosmopolitan extension. The
   following versions of the Lord's Prayer are taken from MM. Couturat

<a name="page101"> </a><span class = "pagenum">101</span>

<p>
   Comparing Volap&uuml;k with Idiom Neutral, even this brief specimen
   is enough to show the main line of improvement. The framers of the
   latter had realized the fact that the vocabulary is the first and
   paramount consideration for an artificial language. It is hopeless to
   expect people to learn strings of words of arbitrary formation and
   like nothing they ever saw. Accordingly Idiom Neutral borrows its
   vocabulary from natural speech, and thereby abandons a regularity
   which may be theoretically more perfect, but which by arbitrary
   disfigurement of familiar words overreaches itself, and does more
   harm than good.
</p>

<p>
   It is very instructive to note that a body of international language
   specialists were brought little by little to adopt an almost
   exclusively Romance vocabulary, and this in spite of the fact that
   they started from Volap&uuml;k, whose vocabulary is constructed on
   quite other lines. In other points their language suffers from being
   too exclusively inspired by Volap&uuml;kist principles, so that their
   recognition of the necessity of an <i>a posteriori</i> vocabulary is
   the more convincing.
</p>

<p>
   Given, then, that vocabulary is to be borrowed and not created anew,
   it is obvious that the principle of borrowing must be <i>maximum of
   internationality of roots</i>&mdash;i.e. those words will be adopted
   by preference which are already common to the greatest number of
   chief languages. Now, by far the greater number of such international
   words (which are far more numerous than was thought before a special
   study was made of the subject) are Romance, being of Latin origin.
   This is the justification of the prevalence of the Romance element
   in any modern artificial language. It has been frequently made a
   reproach against Esperanto that it is a Romance language; but the
   unanimous verdict of the competent linguists who composed the academy
   for the emendation of Volap&uuml;k may be taken as final. They
   threshed the question out once for all, and their conclusion derives
   added force from the fact that it is the result of conversion.
</p>

<p>
   But it may be doubted whether they have not gone rather far in this
   direction and overshot the mark.
</p>

<!-- 111.png -->

<a name="page102"> </a><span class = "pagenum">102</span>

<p>
   Comparing Idiom Neutral with Esperanto, it will be found that the
   latter admits a larger proportion of non-Romance words. While fully
   recognizing and doing justice to the accepted principle of selection,
   maximum of internationality, Esperanto sometimes gives the preference
   to a non-Romance word in order to avoid ambiguity and secure a
   perfectly distinct root from which to form derivatives incapable of
   confusion with others.<sup>1</sup> There is always a good reason for the choice;
   but it is easier to appreciate this after learning the language.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>It is obvious, too, that English, Germans, and Slavs will be more
   attracted to a language which borrows some of its features from their
   own tongues, than to an entirely Romance language. This relatively
   wider international appeal is another advantage of Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   But a mere comparison of the brief texts given above will bring
   out another point in favour of Esperanto&mdash;its full vocalic
   endings. On the other hand, many words in Idiom Neutral present
   a mutilated appearance to the eye, and, what is a much greater
   sin in an international language, offer grave difficulties of
   pronunciation to speakers of many nations. Words ending with a double
   consonant are very frequent, e.g. <i>nostr patr</i>; and these
   will be unpronounceable for many nations, e.g. for an Italian or a
   Japanese. Euphony is one of the strongest of the many strong points
   of Esperanto. In it the principle of maximum of internationality
   has been applied to <i>sounds</i> as well as <i>forms</i>, and
   there are very few sounds that will be a stumbling-block to
   any considerable number of speakers. Some of its modern rivals seem
   to forget that a language is to be spoken as well as written. When
   a language is unfamiliar to the listener, he is greatly aided in
   understanding it if the vowel-sounds are long and full and
   the pronunciation slow, almost drawling. Esperanto fulfils these
   requisites in a marked degree. It is far easier to dwell upon
   two-syllabled words with full vocalic endings like <i>patro
   nia</i> than upon awkward words like <i>nostr patr</i>.
</p>

<p>
   Yet another advantage of Esperanto is illustrated in the same texts.
   Owing to its system of inflexion and the possession of an

<!-- 112.png -->

<a name="page103"> </a><span class = "pagenum">103</span>

   objective case, it is extremely flexible, and can put the words
   in almost any order, without obscuring the sense. Thus, in the
   translation of the <i>Pater Noster</i>, the Esperanto text follows
   the Latin <i>word for word and in the same order</i>. It is obvious
   that this flexibility confers great advantages for purposes of
   faithful and spirited translation.

   between the rival schemes are narrowing down, and, as mentioned in
   the last chapter, there is a family likeness between many of the
   newer projects. The chief of these are: Idiom Neutral; Pan-Roman or
   Universal, by Dr. Molenaar; Latino sine flexione, by Prof. Peano;
   Mundolingue; Nuove-Roman; and Lingua Komun.
</p>

<p>
   These have been grouped together by certain adversaries as
   "Neo-Roman"; but their partisans seem to prefer the collective term
   "Neo-Latin." There are more or less vague hopes that out of them may
   be evolved a final form of international language, for which the
   names <i>Pan-European</i> and <i>Union-Ling</i> have been suggested.
   Dr. Molenaar has declared his willingness to keep to his original
   title, Pan-Roman, for his own language, if the composite one should
   prefer to be called <i>Universal</i>. Prof. Peano says, in the course
   of an article (written in his own language, of course), "any fresh
   solution in the future can only differ from Idiom Neutral, as two
   medical or mathematical treatises dealing with the same subject."
</p>

   The only definite scheme for common action put forth up to

<a name="page104"> </a><span class = "pagenum">104</span>

   now seems to be that proposed by Dr. Molenaar. In January 1907 he
   sent round a circular written in French, in which he makes the
   following propositions:
</p>

<p>
   All authors and notable partisans of Neo-Latin universal
   languages shall meet in a special academy, which will elaborate a
   compromise-language.
</p>

<p>
   As regards the programme, the three fundamental principles shall be:

   Of these principles, No. 1 is to take precedence of No. 2, and No. 2

<p>
   The number of collaborators is to be limited to about twenty, and the
   chairman is to be a non-partisan.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
   Such, in outline, is the proposal of Dr. Molenaar. An obvious
   criticism is that it falls back into the old mistake of putting
   grammar before vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
   From a practical point of view such a composite scheme is not
   likely to meet with acceptance. It will be very hard for authors of
   languages to be impartial and sacrifice their favourite devices

<!-- 114.png -->

<a name="page105"> </a><span class = "pagenum">105</span>

   to the common opinion. M. Bollack, author of the <i>Langue bleue</i>,
   has already refused the chairmanship. He does not see the use of
   founding a fresh academy, and thinks Dr. Molenaar would do better to
   join forces with the Neutralists.
</p>

<p>
   There exists indeed already an "Akademi International de Lingu
   Universal," which has produced Idiom Neutral, and of which Mr. Holmes
   is still director, now in his second term
   (see <a href="#partIIchapterV">preceding chapter</a>).
   This academy is said to be too one-sided in its composition, and not
   scientific. But it is hard to see how it will abdicate in favour of a
   new one.
</p>

<p>
   Meantime, the victorious Esperantists, at present in possession
   of the field, poke fun at these new-fangled schemes. A parody in
   Esperanto verse, entitled <i>Lingvo de Molenaar</i>, and sung to the
   tune of the American song <i>Riding down from Bangor</i>, narrates
   the fickleness of Pan-Roman and how it changed into Universal. It
   is said that a group of Continental Esperantists, at a convivial
   sitting, burnt the apostate Idiom Neutral in effigy by making a
   bonfire of Neutral literature. On the other side amenities are not
   wanting. It is now the fashion to sling mud at a rival language by
   calling it "arbitrary" and "fantastic"; and these epithets are freely
   applied to Esperanto. Strong in their cause, the Esperantists are
   peacefully preparing the Congress of Cambridge.

   Happy is the nation that has no history,&mdash;still happier the
   international language; for a policy of "pacific penetration" offers
   few picturesque incidents to furnish forth a readable narrative.
   In the case of Esperanto there have been no splits or factions;
   no narrow ring of oligarchs has cornered the language for its own
   purposes, or insisted upon its aristocratic and non-popular side in
   the supposed interests of culture or literary taste; consequently

<!-- 115.png -->

<a name="page106"> </a><span class = "pagenum">106</span>

   there has been no secession of the <i>plebs</i>. In the early days
   of Esperanto there was indeed an attempt to found an Esperanto
   league; but when it was seen that the league did little beyond
   suggest alterations, it was wisely dissolved in 1894. Since then
   Esperanto has been run purely on its merits as a language, and has
   expressly dissociated itself from any political, pacifist, or other
   propaganda. Its story is one of quiet progress&mdash;at first very
   slow, but within the last five years wonderfully rapid, and still
   accelerating. The most sensational episode in this peaceful advance
   was the prohibition of the principal Esperantist organ by the Russian
   censorship, so that there is little to do, save record one or two
   leading facts and dates.
</p>

<p>
   The inventor of Esperanto is a Polish doctor, Ludwig Lazarus
   Zamenhof, now living in Warsaw. He was born in 1859 at Bielostock,
   a town which has lately become notorious as the scene of one of
   the terrible Russian <i>pogroms</i>, or interracial butcheries.
   This tragedy was only the culmination of a chronic state of
   misunderstanding, which long ago so impressed the young Zamenhof
   that, when still quite a boy, he resolved to labour for the
   removal of one cause of it by facilitating mutual intercourse. He
   has practically devoted his life first to the elaboration of his
   language, and of later years to the vast amount of business that its
   extension involves. And it has been a labour of love. Zamenhof is
   an idealist. His action, in all that concerns Esperanto, has been
   characterized throughout by a generosity and self-effacement that
   well correspond to the humanitarian nature of the inspiration that
   produced it. He has renounced all personal rights in and control
   of the Esperanto language, and kept studiously in the background
   till the first International Congress two years ago forced him into
   the open, when he emerged from his retirement to take his rightful
   place before the eyes of the peoples whom his invention had brought
   together.
</p>

<p>
   But he is not merely an idealist: he is a practical idealist. This is
   shown by his self-restraint and practical wisdom in guiding events.
   One of the symptoms of "catching Esperanto" is a

<!-- 116.png -->

<a name="page107"> </a><span class = "pagenum">107</span>

   desire to introduce improvements. This morbid propensity to jejune
   amateur tinkering, a kind of measles of the mind (<i>morbus
   linguificus</i><sup>1</sup>) attacks the immature in years or judgment. A riper
   acquaintance with the history and practical aims of international
   language purges it from the system. We have all been through it.
   For the inventor of Esperanto, accustomed for so many years to
   retouch, modify, and revise, it must require no ordinary degree
   of self-control to keep his hands off, and leave the fate of his
   offspring to others. It grew with his growth, developing with his
   experience, and he best knows where the shoe pinches and what might
   yet be done. But he has the fate of Volap&uuml;k before his eyes. He
   knows that, having wrought speech for the people, he must leave it to
   the people, if he wishes them to use and keep using it.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>An expressive (homoeopathic) name for this malady may be coined
   in Esperanto: <i>malsano lingvotrudema</i> = officious or intrusive
   disease, consisting in an itch for coining language.
</p>

<p>
   Contrast the uncompromising attitude of the inventor of Volap&uuml;k,
   Bishop Schleyer. It will be remembered how he let Volap&uuml;k run
   upon the rocks rather than relinquish the helm. He has been nicknamed
   "the Volap&uuml;kist Pope"&mdash;and indeed he made the great and
   fatal bull of believing in his own infallibility. Zamenhof has never
   pretended to this. When he first published his language, he made
   no claim to finality on its behalf. He called for criticisms, and
   contemplated completing and modifying his scheme in accordance with
   them. He even offered to make over this task to a duly constituted
   academy, if people would come forward and throw themselves into the
   work. Again, some years later, in a pamphlet, <i>Choix d'une langue
   Internationale</i>, he proposed a scheme for obtaining a competent
   impartial verdict, and declared his willingness to submit to it.
   At one time he thought of something in the nature of a plebiscite.
   Later, his renunciation of the last vestige of control, in giving up
   the <i>aprobo</i>, or official sanction of books; his attitude at
   the international congresses; his refusal to accept the presidency;
   his reluctance

<!-- 117.png -->

<a name="page108"> </a><span class = "pagenum">108</span>

   to name or influence the selection of the members of the body charged
   with the control of the language; his declaration that his own works
   have no legislative power, but are merely those of an Esperantist;
   finally, his sane conception of the scope and method of future
   development of the language to meet new needs, and of the limits
   within which it is possible&mdash;all this bespeaks the man who has
   a clear idea of what he is aiming at, and a shrewd grasp of the
   conditions necessary to ensure success.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
   The word Esperanto is the present participle of the verb
   <i>esperi</i>&mdash;"to hope," used substantially. It was under the
   pseudonym of Dr. Esperanto that Zamenhof published his scheme in 1887
   at Warsaw, and the name has stuck to the language. Before publication
   it had been cast and recast many times in the mind of its author,
   and it is curious to note that in the course of its evolution he had
   himself been through the principal stages exhibited in the history
   of artificial language projects for the last three hundred years.
   That is to say, he began with the idea of an <i>a priori</i> language
   with made-up words and arbitrary grammar, and gradually advanced to
   the conception of an <i>a posteriori</i> language, borrowing its
   vocabulary from the roots common to several existing languages and
   presenting in its grammar a simplification of Indo-European grammar.
</p>

<p>
   He began to learn English at a comparatively advanced stage of
   his education, and the simplicity of its grammar and syntax was a
   revelation to him. It had a powerful influence in helping him to
   frame his grammar, which underwent a new transformation. Specimens of
   the language as Zamenhof used to speak it with his school and student
   friends show a wide divergence from its present form. He seems to
   have had cruel disappointments, and was disillusioned by the falling
   away of youthful comrades who had promised to fight the battles of
   the language they practised with enthusiasm at school. During long
   years of depression work at the language seems to have been almost
   his one resource. Its absolute simplicity is deceptive as to the
   immense labour it

<!-- 118.png -->

<a name="page109"> </a><span class = "pagenum">109</span>

   must have cost a single man to work it out. This is only fully to
   be appreciated by one who has some knowledge of former attempts.
   Zamenhof himself admits that, if he had known earlier of the
   existence of Volap&uuml;k, he would never have had the courage to
   continue his task, though he was conscious of the superiority of his
   own solution. When, after long hesitation, he made up his mind to try
   his luck and give his language to the world, Volap&uuml;k was strong,
   but already involved in internal strife.
</p>

<p>
   Zamenhof's book appeared first in Russian, and the same year (1887)
   French and German editions appeared at Warsaw. The first instruction
   book in English appeared in the following year. The only name on the
   title-page is "St.&nbsp;J.," and it passed quite unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
   Progress was at first very slow. The first Esperanto society
   was founded in St. Petersburg, 1892, under the name of <i>La
   Espero</i>. As early as 1889 the pioneer Esperanto newspaper, <i>La
   Esperantisto</i><sup>1</sup> conducted chiefly by Russians and circulated mainly
   in Russia, began to appear in Nuremberg, where there was already a
   distinguished Volap&uuml;k club, afterwards converted to Esperanto.
   Since then Nuremberg has continued to be a centre of light in the
   movement for an international language. The other pioneer newspapers
   were <i>L'Espirantiste</i>, founded in 1898 at Epernay by the Marquis
   de Beaufront, and <i>La Lumo</i> of Montreal.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Afterwards prohibited in Russia, owing to the collaboration of
   Count Tolstoi, and transferred to Upsala under the name <i>Lingvo
   Internacia</i>. Since 1902 it has been published in Paris.
</p>

<p>
   In Germany in the early days of Esperanto the great apostles were
   Einstein and Trompeter, and it was owing to the liberality of the
   latter that the Nuremberg venture was rendered possible.
</p>

<p>
   Somewhat later began in France the activity of the greatest and
   most fervent of all the apostles of Esperanto, the Marquis de
   Beaufront. By an extraordinary coincidence he had ready for the
   press a grammar and complete dictionary of a language of his own,
   named <i>Adjuvanto</i>. When he became acquainted with Esperanto, he
   recognized that it was in certain points superior to his own

<!-- 119.png -->

<a name="page110"> </a><span class = "pagenum">110</span>

   language, though the two were remarkably similar. He suppressed his
   own scheme altogether, and threw himself heart and soul into the
   work of spreading Esperanto. In a series of grammars, commentaries,
   and dictionaries he expounded the language and made it accessible
   to numbers who, without his energy and zeal, would never have been
   interested in it. Among other well-known French leaders are General
   Sebert, of the French Institute, M. Boirac, Rector of the Dijon
   University, and M. Gaston Moch, editor of the <i>Ind&eacute;pendance
   Belge</i>.
</p>

<p>
   In England the pioneer was Mr. Joseph Rhodes, who, with Mr. Ellis,
   founded the first English group at Keighley in November 1902.<sup>1</sup> Just
   a year later appeared the first English Esperanto journal, <i>The
   Esperantist</i>, edited by Mr. H. Bolingbroke Mudie, London. Since
   1905 it has been incorporated with <i>The British Esperantist</i>,
   the official organ of the British Esperanto Association. The
   association was founded in October 1904.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>The foundation of the London Esperanto Club took place at
   practically the same time, and the club became the headquarters of
   the movement in Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
   The first international congress was held at Boulogne in August
   1905. It was organized almost entirely by the president of the
   local group, M. Michaux, a leading barrister and brilliant lecturer
   and propagandist. It was an immense success, and inaugurated
   a series of annual congresses, which are doing great work in
   disseminating the idea of international language. The second
   was held in Geneva, August 1906; and the third will be held at
   Cambridge, August 10&ndash;17, 1907. It is unnecessary to describe
   the congresses here, as an account has been given in an
   <a href="#partIchapterIII">early chapter</a>.
</p>

<p>
   Within the last three or four years Esperanto has spread all over
   the world, and fresh societies and newspapers are springing up on
   every side. Since the convincing demonstration afforded by the Geneva
   Congress, Switzerland is beginning to take the movement seriously.
   Many classes and lectures have been held, and the university is also
   now lending its aid. In the present

<!-- 120.png -->

<a name="page111"> </a><span class = "pagenum">111</span>

   year (1907) an International Esperantist Scientific Office has been
   founded in Geneva, with M. Ren&eacute; de Saussure as director,
   and amongst the members of the auxiliary committee are seventeen
   professors and eight privat-docents (lecturers) of the Geneva
   University.
</p>

<p>
   Its object is to secure the recognition of Esperanto for scientific
   purposes, and to practically facilitate its use. To this end the
   office carries on the work of collecting technical vocabularies of
   Esperanto, with the aid of all scientists whose assistance it may
   receive. This is perhaps the most practical step yet taken towards
   the standardization of technical terms, which is so badly needed
   in all branches of science. A universal language offers the best
   solution of the vexed question, because it starts with a clean
   sheet. Once a term has been admitted, by the competent committee
   for a particular branch of science, into the technical Esperanto
   vocabulary of that science, it becomes universal, because it has
   no pre-existent rivals; and its universal recognition in the
   auxiliary language will react upon writers' usage in their own
   language.
</p>

<p>
   The Geneva office will also aid in editing scientific Esperantist
   reviews; and the chief existing one, the <i>Internacia Scienca
   Revuo</i>, will henceforth be published in Geneva instead of in
   Paris, as hitherto.
</p>

<p>
   The two principal objects of the Esperantist Scientific Association
   are:
</p>

<p>
   1. Scientists should always use Esperanto during their international
   congresses.
</p>

<p>
   2. Scientific periodicals should accept articles written in Esperanto
   (as they now do in the case of English, French, German, and Italian),
   and should publish in Esperanto a brief summary of every article
   written in a national language.
</p>

<p>
   A few weeks after the Geneva Congress there was a controversy on the
   subject of Esperanto between two of the best known and most widely
   read Swiss and French newspapers&mdash;the Paris <i>Figaro</i> and
   the <i>Journal de Geneve</i>. The respective champions were

<!-- 121.png -->

<a name="page112"> </a><span class = "pagenum">112</span>

   the Comte d'Haussonville, of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise,
   and M. de Saussure, a member of a highly distinguished Swiss
   scientific family; and the matter caused a good deal of interest on
   the Continent. France was, in this case, reactionary and <i>ancien
   r&eacute;gime</i>: the smaller Republic backed Esperanto and
   progress. M. de Saussure brought forward facts, and the count served
   up the old arguments about Esperanto being unpatriotic and the
   prejudice it would inflict upon literature. The whole thing was a
   good illustration of a fact that is already becoming prominent in the
   history of the auxiliary language movement&mdash;the scientists are
   much more favourable than the literary men. As regards educational
   reform, the conservative attitude of the classicists is well known,
   though there are many exceptions, especially among real teachers. But
   it is somewhat remarkable that, when the proposed reform deals with
   language, those whose business it is to know about languages should
   not take the trouble to examine the scheme properly, before giving an
   opinion one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
   As this question of the attitude of literary men has, and will have,
   a vital bearing upon the prospects of international language, and
   consequently upon its history, this is perhaps the place to remove
   a misunderstanding. A distinguished literary man objected to the
   foregoing passage as a stricture upon men of letters. His point
   was: "<i>Of course</i> literary men care less for Esperanto than
   scientific men do: it <i>must</i> be so, because they <i>need</i>
   it less." Now this is quite true: there is little doubt that to-day
   science is, perhaps inevitably, more cosmopolitan than letters,
   whatever people may say about "the world-wide republic of letters."
   But it does not meet the point. Esperantists do not <i>complain</i>
   because men of letters are not interested in Esperanto. They have
   their own interests and occupations, and nobody would be so absurd
   as to make it a grievance that they will not submit to have thrust
   upon them a language for which they have no taste or use. What
   Esperantists do very strongly object to is that some literary men
   lend the weight of their name and position to

<!-- 122.png -->

<a name="page113"> </a><span class = "pagenum">113</span>

   irresponsible criticism. Let them take or leave Esperanto as seems
   good to them. Their <i>responsible</i> opinions, <i>based upon due
   study of the question</i>, are always eagerly welcomed. But do not
   let them misrepresent Esperanto to the public, thereby unfairly
   prejudicing its judgment. Such action is unworthy of serious men.
   When a man puts forward criticisms of Esperanto based upon elementary
   errors of fact, or complains that Esperantists will not listen to
   reason because they ignore proposals for change, which have long ago
   been threshed out and found wanting, or are obviously unpractical,
   he is merely showing that he has not studied the question. A fair
   analogy would be the case of a chemist or engineer who had recently
   begun to dabble in Greek in his spare moments, and who should
   undertake to emend the text of Sophocles. His suggestions would show
   that he knew no Greek, that he had never heard of Sir Richard Jebb,
   and that he was ignorant of all the results of scientific textual
   criticism. But here comes in the difference. Such a critic would be
   laughed out of court, and told to mind his own business, or else
   learn Greek before he undertook to emend it. But as international
   language is a novelty to most people, it is thought that any one can
   make, mend, or criticise it. It is not, like Greek, yet recognized
   as a serious subject, and therefore irresponsible criticism is too
   apt to be taken at its face value, merely on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of
   the critic, especially if he happens to be an influential man in some
   other line. Nobody bothers about his qualifications in international
   language; nobody either knows or cares whether he has any claim to be
   heard on the subject at all.
</p>

<p>
   The fact is that international language now has a considerable
   history behind it. A large amount of experience has been amassed, and
   is now available for any one who is willing and competent to go into
   the question. But, in order to do fruitful work in this field, it is
   just as necessary as in any other to be properly equipped, and to
   know where others have left off, before you begin.
</p>

<!-- 123.png -->

<a name="page114"> </a><span class = "pagenum">114</span>

<p>
   At the first international congress at Boulogne the history of
   Esperanto was well summed up in a thoughtful speech by Dr. Bein,
   of Poland, himself a considerable Esperantist author, using the
   <i>nom de guerre</i> "Kabe." He pointed out that we are still in the
   first or propaganda stage of international language, in which it
   is necessary to hold congresses, and the language is treated as an
   end in itself. There is good hope that the second stage may soon be
   reached, in which the language may be sufficiently recognized to take
   its proper place as a means.
</p>

<p>
   Meantime, the first stage of Esperanto has been marked by three
   phases or periods&mdash;the Russian period, the French period, and the
   international period. Each has left its mark upon the language.
</p>

<p>
   The Russian period is associated with the names of Kofman,
   Grabowski, Silesnjov, Gernet, Zinovjev, and many other writers
   of considerable literary power. Being the pioneers, they had to
   prove the capabilities of the language to the world, and in doing
   so they took off some of the rough of the world's indifference
   and scepticism. The language benefited by the fact that the first
   authors were Slavs. The simplicity of the Slav syntax, the logical
   arrangement of the sentences, the perfectly free and natural order of
   the words, passed unconsciously from their native language to the new
   one in the hands of these writers, and have been imitated by their
   successors.
</p>

   The French period is associated chiefly with the name of M. de
   Beaufront. In Russia, side by side with the good points named above,
   certain less desirable Slavisms were creeping in; also there were
   hitherto no scientific dictionaries or explanation of syntax. As Dr.
   Bein says, de Beaufront may be called "the codifier of Esperanto." A
   goodly band of French writers now took the language in hand, and by
   their natural power of expression and exposition, which seems inborn
   in a Frenchman, and by their national passion for lucidity, they have
   no doubt strengthened the impulse of Esperanto towards clear-cut,
   vigorous style.

<p>
   Possibly theorizing has been overdone in France; for, after all, the
   strong point of Esperanto syntax is that there is none to speak of,
   common sense being the guide. It is a pity to set up rules where none
   are necessary, or to do anything that can produce an impression in
   the minds of the uninitiated that learning Esperanto means anything
   approaching the memory drudgery necessary in grasping the rules and
   constructions of national languages.
</p>

<p>
   The third period began soon after the turn of the century, and is
   still in full force. Take up any chance number of any Esperanto
   gazette out of the numbers that are published all over the world;
   you will hardly be able to draw any conclusion as to the nationality
   of the writer of the article you light upon, save perhaps for an
   occasional turn of an unpractised hand. Esperanto now has its style;
   it is&mdash;lucidity based upon common sense and the rudiments of a
   minimized grammar.

   This chapter would not be complete without some account of the
   <i>constitution</i> of Esperanto, and the means which have been
   adopted to safeguard the purity of the language. It will be well
   to quote in full the Declaration adopted at Boulogne, in which
   its aim is set forth, and which forms, as it were, its written
   constitution. For the convenience of readers the Esperanto text and
   English translation are printed in parallel columns.

         Esperanto have, like the opinions and works of any other
         Esperantist, an absolutely private character, and are binding
         upon nobody. The sole foundation of the Esperanto language,
         which is once for all binding upon all Esperantists, is the
         little work <i>Fundamento de Esperanto</i>, in which no one
         has the right to make any change. If any one departs from the
         rules and models given in the said work, he can never justify
         himself with the words "such is the wish or advice of the
         author of Esperanto." In the case of any idea which cannot

         it is recommended to all Esperantists to constantly imitate as
         far as possible that style which is found in the works of the
         creator of Esperanto, who laboured the most abundantly for and

   By the wise provision of Article 4, that the entire grammar and
   framework of Esperanto, as contained within one small book of a
   few pages, is absolutely unchangeable, the future of the language
   is secured. The <i>Fundamento</i> also contains enough root words
   to express all ordinary ideas. Henceforth the worst thing that can
   happen to Esperanto by way of adulteration is that some authors may
   use too many foreign words. The only practical check upon this, of
   course, is the penalty of becoming incomprehensible. But as men
   are on the whole reasonable, and as the only object of writing in
   Esperanto presumably is to appeal to an Esperantist international
   public, this check should be sufficient to prevent the

<!-- 129.png -->

<a name="page120"> </a><span class = "pagenum">120</span>

   use of any word that usage is not tending to consecrate. A certain
   latitude of expansion must be allowed to every language, to enable it
   to move with the times; but beyond this, surely few would have any
   interest in foisting into their discourse words which their hearers
   or readers would not be likely to understand, and those few would
   probably belong to the class who do the same thing in using their
   mother-tongue. No special legislation is needed to meet their case.
</p>

<p>
   For a few years (1901&ndash;1905) the publishing house of Hachette
   had the monopoly of official Esperanto publications, and no work
   published elsewhere could find place in the "Kolekto Esperanto
   aprobita de D-ro Zamenhof." But at the first congress Zamenhof
   announced that he had given up even this control, and Esperanto is
   now a free language.
</p>

<p>
   The official authority, which deals with all matters relating to the
   language itself, is the <i>Lingvo Komitato</i> (Language Committee).
   It was instituted at the first congress, and consists of persons
   appointed for their special competence in linguistic matters. The
   original members numbered ninety-nine, and represented the
   following twenty-eight countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
   Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great
   Britain, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
   Norway, Persia, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
   Switzerland, and the United States.
</p>

<p>
   This committee decides upon its own organization and procedure.
   In practice it selects from among the points submitted to it by
   Esperantists those worthy of consideration, and propounds them to its
   members by means of circulars. It then appoints a competent person or
   small committee to report upon the answers received. Decisions are
   made upon the result of the voting in the members' replies to the
   circulars, as analyzed and tabulated in the report. The functions of
   the committee do not include the making of any alteration whatever in
   the Esperanto part of the <i>Fundamento de Esperanto</i>, which is
   equally sacrosanct for it and for all Esperantists. But there is much
   to be done in correcting

<!-- 130.png -->

<a name="page121"> </a><span class = "pagenum">121</span>

   certain faulty translations of the fundamental Esperanto roots
   into national languages, in defining their exact meaning and giving
   their authorized equivalent in fresh languages, into which they
   were not originally translated. Also the constantly growing output
   of grammars and instruction books of all kinds in every country,
   to say nothing of dictionaries, which are very important, has to
   be carefully watched, in order that errors may be pointed out and
   corrected before they have time to take root.
</p>

<p>
   Thus the Lingva Komitato is in no sense an academy or legislative
   body, having for object to change or improve the language; it is the
   duly constituted and widely representative authority, which watches
   the spread and development of the language, maintaining its purity,
   and helping with judicious guidance.
</p>

<p>
   From this sketch it ought to be clear that Esperanto is no wild-cat
   scheme of enthusiasts or faddists, but a wisely organized attempt to
   wipe out the world's linguistic arrears. Its aim is to bring progress
   in oral and written communication into line with the progress of
   material means of communication and of science.

   The first question usually asked is, "How many Esperantists are
   there?" The answer is, "Nobody knows." The most diverse estimates
   have been made, but none are based on any reliable method of
   computation. In the <i>Histoire de la langue universelle</i>, which
   appeared in 1903 and is written throughout in an impartial and
   scientific spirit, 50,000 was tentatively given as a fairly safe
   estimate. That was before the days of the international congresses,
   and since then the cause has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Not
   a month passes without its crop of new clubs and classes, and the
   pace is becoming fast and furious.

<p>
   A marked change has been noticeable of late in the press of the
   leading countries. It is becoming a rare thing now to see Esperanto
   treated as a form of madness, and the days of contemptuous silence
   are passing away. Esperanto doings are now fairly, fully, and
   accurately reported. The tone of criticism is sometimes favourable,
   sometimes patronizing, sometimes hostile; but it is generally
   serious. It is coming to be recognized that Esperanto is a force
   to be reckoned with; it cannot be laughed off. One or two rivals,
   indeed, are getting a little noisy. They are mostly one-man (not
   to say one-horse) shows, and they do not like to see Esperanto
   going ahead like steam. High on the mountain-side they sit in cold
   isolation, and gaze over the rich fertile plains of Esperanto,
   rapidly becoming populous as the immigrants rush in and stake out
   their claims in the fair "no-man's land."<sup>1</sup> And it makes them
   feel bad, these others! "Jeshurun waxed fat," they cry; "pride goes
   before a fall, remember Volap&uuml;k!" The Esperantists remember
   Volap&uuml;k, close their ranks, and sweep on.

</p>

<p>
   Another good criterion besides the press is the sale of books.
   Large editions are going off everywhere, especially, it would seem,
   in America, where the folk have a habit, once they have struck a
   business proposition, of running it for all it is worth. "Let her go!
   give her hell!" is the word, and "the boys" are just now getting next
   to Esperanto to beat the band.
</p>

<p>
   The British Esperanto Association's accounts show a very steady
   increase in the sale of literature. Considering that it sells books
   at trade prices, that hardly any of them are priced at more than a
   few pence, and none above a shilling or two, the sums realized from
   sale of books in some months are astonishing, and represent a large
   and increasing spread of interest among the public. Owing to the low
   prices, the profit on books is of course not great; but, such as it
   is, it all goes to help the cause. The association is now registered
   as a non-profit-making society under the law of 1867,
   with no share capital and no dividends.

<p>
   As regards official recognition, good progress is being made in

<!-- 132.png -->

<a name="page123"> </a><span class = "pagenum">123</span>

   England (see below); but if the language is anywhere adopted
   universally in government schools, it will certainly be first in
   France. (For an account of the present state of this question, which
   is at present before the French Permanent Educational Commission, see
   <a href="#page030">Part&nbsp;I., chap.&nbsp;vi.</a>).
   Dr. Zamenhof has been decorated by the French Government, and
   Esperanto is already taught in many French schools. For purposes
   of education France is divided into districts, called <i>ressorts
   d'Acad&eacute;mie</i>, within each of which there is a complete
   educational ladder from the primary schools to the university which
   is the culmination of each. The official head of an important
   district is Rector Boirac, head of the Dijon University. He is one of
   the most distinguished of the Esperantists, and is the leading spirit
   at the congresses and on the Lingva Komitato. He has done much for
   Esperanto in the schools of his district, and under the guidance of
   men of his calibre Esperanto is making serious progress in France.

   language, see <a href="#page032">Part&nbsp;I., chap.&nbsp;vi.</a>).

   In Germany one of the foremost men of science of his time, Prof.

   language. He recently was lent for a time to Harvard University,
   U.S.A., and while there gave a great impetus to the study of
   Esperanto. He also spoke in its favour at Aberdeen last year, on the
   occasion of the opening of the new University buildings.
</p>

<p>
   Apropos of the interchange between different countries of professors
   and other teachers, which has to some extent been already tried
   between America and Germany, it is curious to note the attitude
   of Prof. Hermann Diels, Rector of the Berlin University. He is a
   great supporter of the extension of this interchange, which also has
   the approbation of the Kaiser, who attended formally the inaugural
   lecture of one of the American professors, to mark his approbation.
   Prof. Diels commented on the fact that diversity of language was a
   grave obstacle; but though he seems before to have been a champion of
   popularized

<!-- 133.png -->

<a name="page124"> </a><span class = "pagenum">124</span>

   Latin, he now declares himself strongly against any artificial
   language,<sup>1</sup> and advocates the use of English, French, and German.
   This is a modified form of the old Max M&uuml;ller proposal, that all
   serious scientific work should be published in one of six languages.
   It does not seem a very convincing attitude to take up, because
   it ignores the facts: (1) that the actual trend of the world is
   the other way&mdash;towards inclusion of fresh national languages
   among the <i>Kultursprachen</i>, not towards accentuation of the
   predominance of these three; (2) that the increase of specialization
   and new studies at universities is leaving less and less time for
   mastering several difficult languages merely as means to other
   branches of study. Why should everybody have to learn English,
   French, and German?
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Herr Diels quaintly finds that Esperanto has only one
   gender&mdash;the feminine! Surely an ultra-Shavian obsession of
   femininity. It is perhaps some distinction to out-Shaw Bernard Shaw
   in any line.
</p>

<p>
   For the rest, Esperanto is now beginning to take hold in Germany.
   The Germans have, as a general rule, open minds for this kind of
   problem, and are trained to take objective views in linguistic
   matters on the scientific merits of the case. The reason why they
   have been somewhat backward hitherto in the Esperanto movement is
   no doubt their disappointment at the failure of Volap&uuml;k, which
   they had done much to promote. But now that, in spite of this special
   drawback, the first steps have been made, and clubs and papers
   are beginning to spring up again, everything points to powerful
   co-operation from Germany in the future.
</p>

<p>
   In Switzerland progress has been enormous since the Geneva Congress
   of 1906. Many clubs and classes are already formed or in process of
   formation, and university men are supporting the movement. In one
   respect the Swiss are now in the van of the Esperantist world: they
   have just started a newspaper, <i>Esperanto</i>, the prospectus of
   which declares that it will no longer treat the language as an end in
   itself, or make propaganda; it will run on the lines of an ordinary
   weekly, merely using

<!-- 134.png -->

<a name="page125"> </a><span class = "pagenum">125</span>

   Esperanto as a means, inasmuch as it is the language of the paper.
</p>

<p>
   The well-known Swiss veteran philosopher Ernst Naville wrote to
   the Geneva Congress that for thirty years he had regarded the
   introduction of an international language as a necessity, owing to
   the advance of civilization, and the day of realization of this
   object would be one of the greatest dates of history.
</p>

<p>
   It is impossible to go through all the countries of Europe in detail.
   It is probable that the greatest numbers of Esperantists are still
   to be found among the Slav peoples. The language first took root in
   their midst, and was spread far and wide by a distinguished group of
   Slav writers.
</p>

<p>
   Outside Europe, Esperanto is making great strides in the British
   Empire, Japan, and America. There are now Esperantist clubs in
   various parts of India, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, in Malta,
   Singapore, etc. Dr. Pollen, C.I.E., President of the British
   Esperanto Association, has just been touring in India, in the
   interests of the language. Among many satisfactory results is the
   guarantee of handsome sums towards the guarantee fund of the coming
   Cambridge Congress by several native rulers, among others the Mir of
   Khairpur, the Raja of Lunawada, the Nawab of Radhanpur, and the Diwan
   of Palanpur.
</p>

<p>
   In New Zealand, an enterprising pioneer country in many departments,
   the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, is favourable. Not long ago
   he made a speech advocating the introduction of Esperanto into the
   public schools of the colony.
</p>

<p>
   In America big Esperantist societies and classes have sprung up
   with amazing rapidity during the last year. Several universities
   now hold Esperanto classes; the Boston Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology has more than 100 students in its Esperanto class, and,
   among schools, the famous Latin School of Roxbury has led the way
   with over fifty pupils under Prof. Lowell. The press is devoting a
   large amount of attention to Esperanto, and many journals of good
   standing are favourable. <i>The North American Review</i> has taken
   up the language. It printed articles

<!-- 135.png -->

<a name="page126"> </a><span class = "pagenum">126</span>

   in December and January by Dr. Zamenhof and Prof. Macloskie of
   Princeton, and followed them up by courses of lessons. It supplies
   Esperanto literature to its readers at cost price, and reports that
   evidences of interest "have been many and multiply daily."
</p>

<p>
   Among university supporters are Profs. Huntington and Morse of
   Harvard, Prof. Viles, Ohio State University, Prof. Borgerhoff,
   Western Reserve University, Prof. Macloskie of Princeton, etc. On
   the other hand, Prof. Hugo Munsterberg of Harvard is attacking
   Esperanto. His is a good example of the literary man's uninformed
   criticism of the universal language project, because it is based upon
   an old criticism by a German professor (Prof. Hamel) of the defunct
   Volap&uuml;k. Why Esperanto should be condemned for the sins of
   Volap&uuml;k is not obvious.
</p>

<p>
   One other useful aspect of Esperanto remains to be mentioned&mdash;the
   establishment of consulships to give linguistic and other assistance.
   Many towns have already their Esperanto consuls, and in a few years
   there ought to be a haven of refuge for Esperantists abroad nearly
   everywhere.

   (<i>b</i>) <i>Present State of Esperanto in England</i>
</p>

<p>
   The most practical way of spreading Esperanto is to get it taught in
   the schools, so it will be best to state first what has been done so
   far in this matter.
</p>

<p>
   Esperanto has been officially accepted by the local educational
   authorities in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and other provincial
   towns; that is to say, it has been recognized as a subject to be
   taught in evening classes, if there is sufficient demand. At present
   there are classes under the London County Council at the following
   schools: Queen's Road, Dalston (Commercial Centre); Blackheath Road
   (Commercial Centre); Plough Road, Clapham Junction (Commercial
   Centre); Rutland Street, Mile End (Commercial Centre); Myrdle Street,
   Commercial Road; and Hugh Myddleton School, Clerkenwell. Other
   classes held in London are at the Northern Polytechnic, Holloway
   Road; St. Bride's Institute, Bride Lane; City of London College,
   White Street; Co-operative Institute, Plumstead; Working Men's
   College, St. Pancras; Stepney Library, Mile End Road; and a large
   class for teachers is held at the Cusack Institute, Moorfields.
</p>

<p>
   At Keighley, Yorks, the Board of Education has recognized the
   language as a grant-earning subject. Various local authorities give
   facilities, some paying the teacher, others supplying a room. Among
   these are Kingston-on-Thames (Technical Institute), Rochdale, Ipswich
   (Technical School), Grimsby, etc.
</p>

<p>
   It does not appear that Esperanto is yet taught in any public
   elementary school; educational officials, inspectors, etc., have
   yet to learn about the language. Many private schools now teach it,
   and at least one private girls' school of the best type teaches
   it as a regular subject, alongside French and German. It has been
   impossible to get any return or figures as to the extent to which it
   has penetrated into private and proprietary schools. The Northern
   Institute of Languages, perhaps the most important commercial school
   in the North of England, held an Esperanto class with sixty-three
   students.
</p>

<p>
   Two large examining bodies&mdash;the London Chamber of Commerce and
   the Examination Board of the National Union of Teachers&mdash;have
   included Esperanto in their subjects for commercial certificates. At
   the London Chamber of Commerce examination in May 1906 the candidates
   were as follows:

<p>
   There is now a Teachers' Section of the British Esperanto Association
   with an Education Committee, which is carrying on active work in
   promoting Esperanto in the schools.
</p>

<p>
   At an official reception of French teachers in London last year
   by the Board of Education, Mr. Lough, speaking on behalf of the
   Board, made a sympathetic reference to Esperanto. The incident is
   amusingly told in Esperanto by M. Boirac, Rector of Dijon University
   and a noted Esperantist, who was amongst the French professors. Not
   understanding English, he was growing rather sleepy during a long
   speech, when the word "Esperanto" gave him a sudden shock. He thought
   the English official was poking fun at him, but was relieved to hear
   that the allusion had been sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
   At this year's meeting of the Modern Language Society at Durham, the
   Warden of Durham University, Dean Kitchin, in welcoming the society
   to the town and university, gave considerable prominence in his
   speech to Esperanto, remarking that, to judge by its rapid growth and
   the sanity of its reformed grammar, one might easily believe that it
   will win general use.<sup>1</sup> Such references in high places illustrate
   the tendency to admit

<!-- 139.png -->

<a name="page130"> </a><span class = "pagenum">130</span>

   that there may be something in this international language scheme.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>He continued: "To me it seems that Esperanto in vocabulary and
   grammar is a miracle of simplicity."
</p>

<p>
   There are now (May 1907) seventy local Esperanto societies in Great
   Britain on the list of societies affiliated to the British Esperanto
   Association, and often several new ones are formed in a month. The
   first were Keighley and London, founded 1902. Seven more were formed
   in 1903; and since the beginning of 1906 no less than thirty-six.
   Besides the members of these there are a great many learners in
   classes and individual Esperantists who belong to no affiliated
   group. Every month one reads lists of lectures given in the most
   diverse places, very often with the note that a local club or class
   resulted, or that a large sale of Esperanto literature took place.
   Sometimes the immediate number of converts is surprising: e.g.
   on April 22, 1907, after a lecture on Esperanto at the Technical
   College, Darlington, seventy-eight students entered their names for a
   week's course of lessons to be held in the college three times a day.
</p>

<p>
   There are now Esperanto consuls in the following towns: Bradford,
   Chester, Edinburgh, Harrogate, Hull, Hunslet, Keighley, Leeds,
   Liverpool, Nottingham, Oakworth, Plymouth, Rhos, Southampton, and St.
   Helens. Birmingham has within the last few months taken up the cause
   with its usual energy, and now has a large class.
</p>

<p>
   In England the universities have been slow to show interest in
   Esperanto; but now that Cambridge has been selected as the seat of
   the Congress in 1907, the university is granting every facility,
   as also is the town council, in use of rooms and the like, and
   some professors and other members of the university are cordially
   co-operating. Last October Prof. Skeat, one of the fathers
   of English philology, took the chair at a preliminary meeting,
   and made a speech very favourable to Esperanto. He said, "I think
   Esperanto is a very good movement, and I hope it will succeed."
   The subject of Esperanto is being well put before the teachers of
   Cambridgeshire, and the railway companies all over the country and
   abroad are granting special

<!-- 140.png -->

<a name="page131"> </a><span class = "pagenum">131</span>

   fares for the congress.<sup>1</sup> It is probable that the overwhelming
   demonstration of the possibilities of this international language
   will open the eyes of many who have hitherto been indifferent, and
   that the movement will enter on a new phase of expansion in England,
   and through the example of England, which is closely watched abroad,
   in the world at large.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>It is a striking fact that six weeks before the opening of the
   congress 700 members have already secured their tickets.

<p>
   The extent to which more or less artificial languages are already
   used in various parts of the world for the transaction of interracial
   business, and the persistent preoccupation of thinkers with the
   idea for the last 200 years, culminating in the production of a
   great number of schemes in our own times, show that there <i>is</i>
   a demand for an international language, more perfect than has yet
   been available and universally valid. The list of languages proposed
   (see Part II., chap. ii.) by no means represents all that has been
   written and thought upon the subject. Many more have proposed
   solutions of the question, beginning with such men as Becher (1661),
   Kirchner (1665), Porele (1667), Upperdorf (1679), M&uuml;ller
   (1681), Lobkowitz (1687), Besuier (1684), Solbrig (1725), Taboltzafo
   (1772), and continuing down to the present day. The striking success
   of Volap&uuml;k and Esperanto in gaining, within a few years of
   publication, many thousands of ardent supporters has also been a
   revelation. It has proved most conclusively that there is a demand.
   If so many people in all lands have been willing to give up time and
   money to learning and promoting a language from which they could
   not expect to reap anything like full benefit for many years, what
   must be its value when ripened to yield full profits, i.e. when
   universally adopted?
</p>


<!-- 141.png -->

<a name="page132"> </a><span class = "pagenum">132</span>

<p>
   There are two main obstacles to universal adoption. The first is
   common to all projects of reform&mdash;the force of inertia. It is
   hard to win practical support for a new thing, even when assent
   is freely given in theory to its utility. The second is peculiar
   to Esperanto, and consists in the discrediting of the cause of
   international language through the failure of Volap&uuml;k. Good
   examples of its operation are afforded by the slowness of Germany to
   recognize Esperanto, and by the criticism of Prof. M&uuml;nsterberg
   (formerly of Freiburg, Germany) in America, based as it is on an old
   German criticism of Volap&uuml;k, and transferred at second-hand to
   Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   Hence every effort should be made to induce critics of Esperanto to
   examine the language before pronouncing judgment&mdash;to criticise
   the real thing, instead of some bogy of their imagination.
</p>

<p>
   One bogy which has caused much misdirected criticism is raised by
   misunderstanding of the word "universal" in the phrase <i>universal
   language</i>. It is necessary to insist upon the fact that
   "universal" means universally adopted and everywhere current <i>as
   an auxiliary</i> to the mother-tongue for purposes of international
   communication. It does not mean a universal language for home
   consumption as a substitute for national language. In Baconian
   language, this bogy may be called an "idol of the market-place,"
   since it rests upon confusion of terms.
</p>

<p>
   Pursuing the Baconian classification of error, we may call the
   literary man's nightmare of the invasion of literature by the
   universal language an "idol of the theatre." The lesson of experience
   is, that it is well not to alienate the powerful literary interest
   justly concerned in upholding the dignity and purity of national
   speech by making extravagant claims on behalf of the auxiliary
   language. It is capable of conveying <i>matter</i> or <i>content</i>
   in any department of human activity with great nicety; but where it
   is a question of reproducing by actual translation the <i>form</i>
   or <i>manner</i> of some masterpiece of national literature, it will
   not, by nature of its very

<a name="page133"> </a><span class = "pagenum">133</span>

   virtues, give a full idea of the rich play of varied synonymic in the
   original.
</p>

<p>
   The great practical lesson of Volap&uuml;k is, that alteration brings
   dissension, and dissension brings death. A universal language must
   be in essentials, like Esperanto, inviolable. If ever the time comes
   for modification in any essential point, it will be after official
   international recognition in the schools. Gradual reforms could
   then, if necessary, be introduced by authority, as in the case of
   the recent French "Tol&eacute;rations," or the German reforms in
   orthography.
</p>

<p>
   So long as the world is divided among rival great powers, no national
   language can be recognized as universal by them all. It is therefore
   a choice between an artificial language or nothing. As regards
   the structure of the artificial language itself, history shows
   clearly that it must be <i>a posteriori</i>, not <i>a priori</i>.
   It must select its constituent roots and its spoken sounds on the
   principle of maximum of internationality, and its grammar must be
   a simplification of natural existing grammar. On the other hand,
   a recent tendency to brand as "arbitrary" and <i>a priori</i>
   everything that makes for regularity, if it is not directly borrowed,
   is to be resisted. It is possible to overdo even the best of rules by
   slavish and unintelligent application. Thus it is urged by extremists
   that some of the neatest labour-saving devices of Esperanto are
   arbitrary, and therefore to be condemned.

   These words are arbitrary, because not borrowed from national

   learnt Latin, French, and German try how long it takes him

<p>
   Again, the languages upon whose vocabulary and grammar the
   international language is to be based must be Aryan (Indo-European).
   This is a practical point. The non-European peoples will consent
   to learn "simplified Aryan" just as they are adopting Aryan
   civilization; but the converse is not true. The Europeans will go
   without an international language rather than learn one based to some
   extent upon Japanese or Mongolian. The only prescription for securing
   a large field is&mdash;greatest ease for greatest number, with a
   handicap in favour of Europeans, to induce them to enter.

   All national languages are full of redundant and overlapping
   grammatical devices for expressing what could be equally
   well expressed by a single uniform device. They bristle with
   irregularities and exceptions. Their forms and phrases are largely
   the result of chance and partial survival, arbitrary usage, and false
   analogy. It is obvious that a perfectly regular artificial language
   is far easier to learn. But the point to be insisted on here is, that
   artificial simplification of language is no fantastic craze, but
   merely a perfect realization of a natural tendency, which the history
   of language shows to exist.
</p>

<p>
   At first sight this may seem to conflict with what was said in
   <a href="#partIchapterX">Part&nbsp;I., chap.&nbsp;x</a>. But there is no real
   inconsistency. As pointed out there, there is no reason to think that
   Nature, left to herself, would ever produce a universal language, or
   that a simpler language would win, in a struggle with more complex
   ones, on account of its simplicity. But this does not prevent there
   being a real natural tendency to simplification&mdash;though in
   natural languages this tendency is constantly thwarted, and can never
   produce its full effect.
</p>

<p>
   How, then, is this tendency to simplification shown in the

<!-- 145.png -->

<a name="page136"> </a><span class = "pagenum">136</span>

   history of Aryan (Indo-European) languages? For it must be emphasized
   that for the purposes of this discussion history of language means
   history of Aryan language.
</p>

<p>
   The Aryan group of languages includes Sanskrit and its descendants
   in the East, Greek, Latin, all modern Romance languages (French,
   Italian, Spanish, etc.), all Germanic languages (English, German,
   Scandinavian, etc.), all Slav languages (Russian, Polish,
   etc.)&mdash;in fact, all the principal languages of Europe, except
   Hungarian, Basque, and Finnish. The main tendency of this group of
   languages has been, technically speaking, to become analytic instead
   of synthetic&mdash;that is, to abandon complex systems of inflection
   by means of case and verbal endings, and to substitute prepositions
   and auxiliaries. Thus, taking Latin as the type of old synthetic
   Aryan language, its declension of nouns and conjugation of verbs
   present an enormously greater complexity of forms than are employed
   by English, the most advanced of the modern analytical languages, to
   express the same grammatical relations. For example:

<p>
   By the time you have learnt these various Latin case endings
   (<i>-&#259;</i>, <i>-am</i>, <i>-ae</i>, <i>-ae</i>, <i>-&#257;</i>;
   <i>-ae</i>, <i>-as</i>, <i>-arum</i>, <i>-is</i>, <i>-is</i>), you
   have only learnt one out of many types of declension. Passing on to
   the second Latin type or declension, e.g. <i>dominus</i> = master,
   you have to learn a whole fresh set of case endings (<i>-us</i>,
   <i>-um</i>, <i>-i</i>, <i>-o</i>, <i>-o</i>; <i>-i</i>, <i>-os</i>,
   <i>-orum</i>, <i>-is</i>, <i>-is</i>) to express the same grammatical
   relations; whereas in English you apply the same set of prepositions
   to the word "master" without change, except for a uniform <i>-s</i>
   in the plural. As there are a great many types of Latin noun,

<!-- 146.png -->

<a name="page137"> </a><span class = "pagenum">137</span>

   the simplification in English, effected by using invariable
   prepositions without inflection, is very great. It is just the same
   with the verb. Take the English regular verb "to love": the four
   forms <i>love</i>, <i>loves</i>, <i>loving</i>, <i>loved</i>, about
   exhaust the number of forms to be learned (omitting the second
   person singular, which is practically dead); the rest is done by
   auxiliaries, which are the same for each verb. Latin, on the other
   hand, possesses very numerous forms of the verb, and the whole set
   of numerous forms varies for each type of verb. In the aggregate the
   simplification in English is enormous. This process of simplification
   is common to all the modern Aryan languages, but they have not all
   made equal progress in carrying it out.
</p>

<p>
   Now, it is a remarkable fact, and a very suggestive one for those
   who seek to trace the connexion between the course of a nation's
   language and its history, that the degree of progress made by the
   languages of Europe along their common line of evolution does on the
   whole, as a matter of historical fact, correspond with the respective
   degree of material, social, and economic advancement attained by the
   nations that use them. Take this question of case endings. Russia has
   retained a high degree of inflection in her language, having seven
   cases with distinct endings. These seven cases are common to the Slav
   languages in general; two of them (Sorbish and Slovenish) have, like
   Gothic and Greek, a dual number, a feature which has long passed away
   from the languages of Western Europe. Again, the Slav tongues decline
   many more of the numerals than most Aryan languages. Germany, which,
   until the recent formation of the German Empire, was undoubtedly a
   century slow by West European time, still has four cases; or, in
   view of the moribund dative, should we rather say three and a half?
   France and England manage their affairs in a universal nominative<sup>1</sup>
   (if one can give any name to a universal case), as far as nouns,
   adjectives,

<!-- 147.png -->

<a name="page138"> </a><span class = "pagenum">138</span>

   and articles are concerned. Their pronouns offer the sole survival
   of declension by case endings. Here France, the runner-up, is
   a trifle slow in the possession of a real, live dative case of the
   pronoun (acc. <i>le</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>les</i>; dat. <i>lui</i>,
   <i>leur</i>). England wins by a neck with one universal oblique case
   (<i>him</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>them</i>). This insidious suggestion is
   not meant to endanger the <i>entente cordiale</i>; even perfidious
   Albion would not convict the French nation of arrested development on
   the side-issue of pronominal atavism. Mark Twain says he paid
   double for a German dog, because he bought it in the dative case; but
   no nation need be damned for a dative. We have no use for the <i>coup
   de Jarnac</i>.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Though historically, of course, the Low Latin universal case, from
   which many French, and therefore English, words are derived, was the
   accusative.
</p>

<p>
   But consider the article. Here, if anywhere, is a test of the
   power of a language to move with the times. For some reason or
   other (the real underlying causes of these changes in language
   needs are obscure) modern life has need of the article, though
   the highly civilized Romans did very well without it. So strong
   is this need that, in the middle ages, when Latin was used as
   an international language by the learned, a definite article
   (<i>hic</i> or &tau;&#x03cc;) was foisted into the language. How is
   it with the modern world? The Slavs have remained in this matter
   at the point of view of the ancient world. They are articleless.
   Germany has a cumbrous three-gender, four-case article;
   France rejoices in a two-gender, one-case article with
   a distinct form for the plural. The ripe product of tendency, the
   infant heir of the eloquent ages, to whose birth the law of Aryan
   evolution groaned and travailed until but now, the most useful, if
   not the "mightiest," monosyllable "ever moulded by the lips of man,"
   the "the," one and indeclinable, was born in the Anglo-Saxon
   mouth, and sublimed to its unique simplicity by Anglo-Saxon
   progress.
</p>

<p>
   The general law of progress in language could be illustrated equally
   well from the history of genders as exhibited in various languages.
   We are here only dealing with Aryan languages, but, merely by way of
   illustration, it may be mentioned that a primitive African language
   offers seven "genders," or grammatical categories requiring the same
   kind of concords as genders. In

<!-- 148.png -->

<a name="page139"> </a><span class = "pagenum">139</span>

   Europe we pass westward from the three genders of Germany, curving
   through feminine and masculine France (<i>place aux dames!</i>)
   to monogendric Britain. Only linguistic arbitrary gender is
   here referred to; this has nothing to do with suffragettes or
   "defeminization."
</p>

<p>
   Again, take agreement of adjectives. In the ancient world, whether
   Greek, Latin, Gothic, or Anglo-Saxon, adjectives had to follow
   nouns through all the mazes of case and number inflection, and had
   also to agree in gender. In this matter German has gone ahead of
   French, in that its adjectives do not submit to change of form in
   order to indicate agreement, when they are used predicatively (e.g.
   "ein gut<i>er</i> Mann"; "der gut<i>e</i> Mann"; but "der Mann ist
   gut"). But English has distanced the field, and was alone in at the
   death of the old concords, which moistened our childhood's dry Latin
   <i>with</i> tears.
</p>

<p>
   Whatever test be applied, the common tendency towards simplification,
   from synthesis to analysis, is there; and in its every manifestation
   English has gone farthest among the great literary languages. It is
   necessary to add this qualification&mdash;"among the great literary
   languages"&mdash;because, in this process of simplification, English
   has a very curious rival, and possibly a superior, in the <i>Taal</i>
   of South Africa. The curious thing is that a local dialect should
   have shown itself so progressive, seeing that the distinctive note
   of most dialects is conservatism, their chief characteristics being
   local survivals.<sup>1</sup> It is probable that the advanced degree of
   simplification attained by the Taal is the result of deliberate and
   conscious adaptation of their language by the original settlers to
   the needs of the natives. Just as Englishmen speak Pidgin-English
   to coolies in the East, so the old trekkers must have removed
   irregularities and concords from their

<!-- 149.png -->

<a name="page140"> </a><span class = "pagenum">140</span>

   Dutch, so that the Kaffirs could understand it. If this is so, it is
   another illustration of the essential feature that an international
   language must possess. Even the Boer farmers, under the stress of
   practical necessity, grasped the need of simplification.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Of course a difference must be expected between a dialect spoken
   by a miscellaneous set of settlers in a foreign land and one in use
   as an indigenous growth from father to son. But the <i>habitants</i>,
   as the French settlers in Quebec are called, who, like the Boers, are
   mainly a pastoral and primitive people, have retained an antiquated
   form of French, with no simplification.
</p>

<p>
   The natural tendency towards elimination of exceptions is also
   strongly marked in the speech of the uneducated. Miss Loane, who has
   had life-long experience of nursing work among the poorest classes in
   England, tabulates (<i>The Queen's Poor</i>, p. 112) the points in
   which at the present day the language of the poor differs from that
   of the middle and upper classes. Under the heading of grammar she
   singles out specially superabundance of negatives, and then proceeds:
   "Other grammatical errors. These are nearly all on the lines of
   simplification. It is correct to say 'myself, herself, yourself,
   ourselves.' Very well: let us complete the list with 'hisself' and
   'theirselves.' Most verbs are regular: why not all? Let us say
   'comed' and 'goed,' 'seed' and 'bringed' and 'teached.'" Miss Loane
   probably exaggerates with her "nearly all." For instance, as regards
   the uneducated form of the past tense of "to come," surely "come" is
   a commoner form than "comed." Similarly the illiterate for "I did" is
   "I done," not "I doed," which would be the regular simplification.
   But the natural tendency is certainly there, and it is strong.
</p>

<p>
   Precisely the same tendency is observable in the present development
   of literary languages. They have all inherited many irregular verbal
   conjugations from the past as part of their national property, and
   these, by the nature of the case, comprise most of the commonest
   words in the language, because the most used is the most subject
   to abbreviation and modification. But these irregular types of
   inflection have long been dead, in the sense that they are fossilized
   survivals, incapable of propagating their kind. When a new word
   is admitted into the language, it is conjugated regularly. Thus,
   though we still say "I go&mdash;I went; I run&mdash;I ran," because
   we cannot help ourselves, when we are free to choose we say, "I
   cycle&mdash;I cycled; I wire&mdash;I wired"; just as the French say
   "t&eacute;l&eacute;graphier," and not "t&eacute;l&eacute;graphir,"
   -oir, or -re.
</p>

<!-- 150.png -->

<a name="page141"> </a><span class = "pagenum">141</span>

<p>
   Considering the strength of this stream of natural tendency, it seems
   a most natural thing to start again, for international purposes, with
   a form of simplified Aryan language, and, being free from the dead
   hand of the past, to set up the simplest forms of conjugation, etc.,
   and make every word in the language conform to them.
</p>

<p>
   Indeed, this question of artificial simplification of language has of
   late years emerged from the scholar's study and become a matter of
   practical politics, even as regards the leading national languages.
   Within the last few years there have been official edicts in France
   and Germany, embodying reforms either in spelling or grammar, with
   the sole object of simplifying. The latest attempt at linguistic
   jerrymandering has been the somewhat autocratic document of President
   Roosevelt. He has found that there are limits to what the American
   people will stand even from him, and it seems likely to remain a
   dead letter. But there is not the smallest doubt that the English
   language is heavily handicapped by its eccentric vowel pronunciation
   and its spelling that has failed to keep pace with the development
   of the language. The same is true, though in a lesser degree, of
   the spelling and pronunciation of French. Since the whole theory
   of spelling&mdash;and, until a few hundred years ago, its practice
   too&mdash;consisted in nothing else but an attempt to represent
   simply and accurately the spoken word, most unprejudiced people
   would admit that simplification is in principle advisable. But the
   practical difficulties in the way of simplification of a national
   language are almost prohibitive. It is hard to see that there are any
   such obstacles in the way of the adoption of a simple and perfectly
   phonetic international artificial language. We dislike change because
   it is change, and new things because they are new. We go on suffering
   from a movable Easter, which most practically inconveniences great
   numbers of people and interests, and seems to benefit no one at all,
   simply because it is no one's business to change it. If once the
   public could be got to examine seriously the case for an artificial
   international language, they could hardly

<!-- 151.png -->

<a name="page142"> </a><span class = "pagenum">142</span>

   fail to recognize what an easy, simple, and <i>natural</i> thing it
   is, and how soon it would pay off all capital sunk in its universal
   adoption, and be pure profit.
</p>

<p align="center" class="majusklete">
   Note
</p>

<p>
   This seems the best place to deal with a criticism of Esperanto which
   has an air of plausibility. It is urged that Esperanto does not carry
   the process of simplification far enough, and that in two important
   points it shows a retrograde tendency to revert to a more primitive
   stage of language, already left behind by the most advanced natural
   languages. These points are:
</p>

      </tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
   Now, it must be borne in mind that the business of a universal
   language is, not to adhere pedantically to any philological
   theory, not to make a fetish of principle, not to strive after
   any theoretical perfection in the observance of certain laws
   of construction, but&mdash;simply to be easy. The principle of
   simplification is an admirable one, because it furthers this end,
   and for this reason only. The moment it ceases to do so, it must
   give way before a higher canon, which demands that an international
   language shall offer the greatest ease, combined with efficiency, for
   the greatest number. The fact that a scientific study of language
   reveals a strong natural tendency towards simplification, and that
   this tendency has in certain languages assumed certain forms, is
   not in itself a proof that an artificial language is bound to
   follow the historical lines of evolution in every detail. It will
   follow them just so far as, and no farther than, they conduce to
   its paramount end&mdash;greatest ease for greatest number, plus
   maximum of efficiency. In constructing an international language,
   the question then becomes, in each case that comes up for decision:
   How far does the proposed simplification conduce to ease without
   sacrificing efficiency? Does the cost of retention (reckoned in terms
   of sacrifice of ease) of the unsimplified form

<!-- 152.png -->

<a name="page143"> </a><span class = "pagenum">143</span>

   outweigh the advantages (reckoned in terms of efficiency) it confers,
   and which would be lost if it was simplified out of existence? Let
   us then examine briefly the two points criticised, remembering that
   the main function of the argument from history of language is, not
   to deduce therefrom hard-and-fast rules for the construction of
   international language, but to remove the unreasoning prejudice of
   numerous objectors, who cannot pardon the international language for
   being "artificial," i.e. consciously simplified.

<p align="center">
   (1) <i>The Accusative Case</i>
</p>

<p>
   This is formed in Esperanto by adding the letter <i>-n</i>. This one
   form is universal for nouns, adjectives, and pronouns singular and
   plural. Ex.:
</p>

<center>
   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="The accusative case.">
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">Nom.&nbsp;</td>

<td nowrap="nowrap" align="center" valign="middle">&nbsp;plural,&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>bonaj patroj</i>.</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">Acc.&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>bonan patron</i></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="center" valign="middle">"</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>bonajn patrojn</i>.</td></tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
   Suppose one were to suppress this <i>-n</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (<i>a</i>) Cost of retention of unsimplified form: Remembering to add
   this <i>-n</i>.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
   (<i>b</i>) Advantages of retention: The flexibility of the language
   is enormously increased; the words can be put in any order without
   obscuring or changing the sense. Ex.:
</p>
<p class="dekstre" style="margin-top: 0">
   <i>La patro amas sian filon</i> = the father loves his son.<br/>
   <i>Sian filon amas la patro</i> (in English "his son loves the father" has a different sense).<br/>
   <i>Amas la patro sian filon</i> (= the father <i>loves</i> his son, but...).<br/>
   <i>La patro sian filon amas</i>.<br/>
   <i>Sian filon la patro amas</i> (= it is his son that the father loves).
</p>

<p>
   In every case the Esperanto sentence is perfectly clear, the meaning
   is the same, but great scope is afforded for emphasis and shades of
   gradation. Further, every nation is enabled to arrange the words as
   suits it best, without becoming less intelligible to other nations.
   Readers of Greek and Latin know the enormous advantage of free word
   order. For purposes of

<!-- 153.png -->

<a name="page144"> </a><span class = "pagenum">144</span>

   rendering the spirit and swing of national works of literature in
   Esperanto, and for facilitating the writing of verse, the accusative
   is a priceless boon. Is the price too high?
</p>

<p>
   N.B.&mdash;Those people who are most apt to omit the <i>-n</i> of the
   accusative, having no accusative in their own language, generally
   make their meaning perfectly clear without it, because they are
   accustomed to indicate the objective case by the order in which they
   place their words. They make a mistake of Esperanto by omitting the
   <i>-n</i>, but they are understood, which is the essential.
</p>

<p align="center">
   (2) <i>The Agreement of Adjectives</i>
</p>

<p>
   Adjectives in Esperanto agree with their substantives in number
   and case. Ex.: <i>bona patro</i>, <i>bonan patron</i>, <i>bonaj
   patroj</i>, <i>bonajn patrojn</i>.
</p>

<p>
   Suppose one were to suppress agreement of adjectives.
</p>

<p>
   (<i>a</i>) Cost of retention of agreement: Remembering to add
   <i>-j</i> for the plural and <i>-n</i> for the accusative.
</p>

<p>
   (<i>b</i>) Advantages of retention: Greater clearness; conformity
   with the usage of the majority of languages; euphony.
</p>

<p>
   Esperanto has wisely adopted full, vocalic, syllabic endings for
   words. Contrast Esp. <i>bon&#8209;o</i> with French <i>bon</i>, Eng.
   <i>good</i>, Germ. <i>gut</i>. By this means Esperanto is not only
   rendered slower, more harmonious, and easier of comprehension; it
   is also able to denote the parts of speech clearly to eye and ear
   by their form. Thus final <i>-o</i> bespeaks a noun; <i>-a</i>, an
   adjective; <i>-e</i>, an adverb; <i>-i</i>, an infinitive, etc.
</p>

<p>
   Now, since all adjectives end in syllabic <i>-a</i>, it is much
   harder to keep them uninflected than if they ended with a consonant
   like the Eng. "good." To talk about <i>bona patroj</i> would not
   only seem a hideous barbarism to all Latin peoples, whose languages
   Esperanto most resembles, but it would also offend the bulk of
   Northerners. After a very little practice it is really easier to say
   <i>bonaj patroj</i> than <i>bona patroj</i>. The assimilation of
   termination tempts the ear and tongue.
</p>

<!-- 154.png -->

<a name="page145"> </a><span class = "pagenum">145</span>

<p>
   The grammar is also simplified. For if adjectives agreeing with
   nouns and pronouns expressed were invariable, it would probably be
   necessary to introduce special rules to meet the case of adjectives
   standing as nouns, or where the qualified word was suppressed.
</p>

<p>
   Again, is the price too high compared to the advantages?

<p>
   (1) Esperanto takes a natural place at the beginning of the sequence
   of languages, upon which is founded the scheme of language-teaching
   in the Reform Schools of Germany, and in some of the more progressive
   English schools.
</p>

<p>
   The principle involved in this scheme is that of orderly progression
   from the easier to the more difficult. Only one foreign language is
   begun at a time. The easiest language in the school curriculum is
   begun first. Enough hours per week are devoted to this language to
   allow of decent progress being made. When the pupils have a fair grip
   of the elements of one language, another is begun. The bulk of the
   school language-teaching hours are now devoted to the new language,
   and sufficient weekly hours are given to the language already learnt
   to avoid backsliding at least. Thus in a German school of the new
   type the linguistic hours are devoted in the lowest classes to the
   mother-tongue. When the pupils have some idea what language means,
   and have acquired some notion of grammar, they are given a school
   year or two of French. After this Latin is begun in the upper part of
   the school, and Greek at a corresponding interval after Latin.
</p>

<p>
   Now, it is one of the commonest complaints of teachers in our
   secondary schools that they have to begin teaching Latin or

<!-- 155.png -->

<a name="page146"> </a><span class = "pagenum">146</span>

   French to boys who have no knowledge whatever of grammar. Fancy the
   hopelessness of trying to teach an English boy the construction of
   a Latin or French sentence when he does not know what a relative or
   demonstrative pronoun means! This is the fate of so many a master
   that quite a number of them resign themselves to giving up a good
   part of their French or Latin hour to endeavouring to imbue their
   flock with some notions of grammar in general. They naturally try to
   appeal to their boys through the medium of their own language. But
   those who have incautiously upset their class from the frying-pan
   of <i>qui</i>, <i>quae</i>, <i>quod</i>, into the fire of English
   demonstrative and relative pronouns get a foretaste of the fire that
   dieth not. <i>Facilis descensus Averni.</i> Happy if they do not lose
   heart, and step downward from the fire to ashes&mdash;reinforced with
   sackcloth.
</p>

<p>
   "I contend that that 'that' that that gentleman said was right." This
   is the "abstract and brief chronicle" of their woes&mdash;sometimes,
   indeed, the epitaph of their pedagogical career, if they are too
   sickened of the Sisiphean task of trying to teach grammar on
   insufficient basis. And this use, or abuse, of the hardworked word
   "that" is only an extreme case which illustrates the difficulty
   of teaching grammar to babes, through the medium of a language
   honeycombed with synonyms, homonyms, exceptions, and other pitfalls
   (can you be honeycombed with a pitfall?)&mdash;a language which
   seems to take a perverse delight in breaking all its own rules and
   generally scoring off the beginner. And for the dull beginner, what
   language does not seem to conform to this type? Answer: Esperanto.
</p>

<p>
   In other words, it would seem that, for the grinding of grammar and
   the advancement of sound learning in the initial stage, there is
   nothing like an absolutely uniform and regular language,<sup>1</sup> a

<!-- 156.png -->

<a name="page147"> </a><span class = "pagenum">147</span>

   <i>type tongue</i>, something that corresponds in the linguistic
   hierarchy to Euclid or the first rules of arithmetic in the
   mathematical, something clear, consistent, self-evident, and of
   universal application.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Cf. Sir Oliver Lodge: "It would certainly appear that for this
   purpose [i.e. educative language-learning for children] the fully
   inflected ancient languages are best and most satisfactory; if
   they were still more complete and regular, like Esperanto, they
   would be better still to begin with" (<i>School Teaching and School
   Reform</i>, p.&nbsp;21: chapter on Curricula and Methods).
</p>

<p>
   Take our sentence again: "I contend that that 'that' that that
   gentleman said was right." If our beginner has imbibed his first
   notions of grammar through the medium of a type language, in
   which a noun is always a noun, and is stamped as such by its form
   (this, by the way, is an enormous aid in making the thing clear to
   children); in which an adjective is always an adjective, and is
   stamped as such by its form; and so on through all the other parts of
   speech,&mdash;when the teacher comes to analyse the sentence given,
   he will be able to explain it by reference to the known forms of the
   regular key-language. He will point out that of the "thats": the
   first is the Esperanto <i>ke</i> (which is final, because <i>ke</i>
   never means anything else); the second is <i>tiu</i> (at once
   revealed by its form to be a demonstrative), the fourth <i>kiu</i>,
   and so on. As for the third "that," which <i>is</i> rather hard
   for a child to grasp, he will be able to make it into a noun in
   form by merely adding <i>-o</i> to the Esperanto equivalent for any
   "that" required. He will not be doing violence to the language; for
   Esperanto consists of roots, which habitually do duty as noun, verb,
   adjective, etc., according to the termination added. Those who know
   the value of the concrete and tangible in dealing with children will
   grasp the significance of the new possibilities that are thus for the
   first time opened up to language-teachers.
</p>

<p>
   To sum up: Natural languages are all hard, and the beginner can
   never go far enough to get a rule fixed soundly in his mind without
   meeting exceptions which puzzle and confuse him. Esperanto is as
   clear, logical, and consistent as arithmetic, and, like arithmetic,
   depends more upon intelligence than upon memory work. If Esperanto
   were adopted as the first foreign language to be taught in schools,
   and all grammatical teaching were postponed until Esperanto had been
   begun, and then given entirely through the medium of Esperanto until
   a sound notion of

<!-- 157.png -->

<a name="page148"> </a><span class = "pagenum">148</span>

   grammatical rules and categories had been instilled, it would
   probably be found that the subsequent task of learning natural
   languages would be facilitated and abridged. From the very start it
   would be possible to prevent certain common errors and confusions,
   that tend to become engrained in juvenile minds by the fluctuating
   or contradictory usage of their own language, to their great let and
   hindrance in the subsequent stages of language-learning. The skeleton
   outline of grammatical theory with concrete examples afforded by
   Esperanto would shield against vitiating initial mistakes, in
   much the same way as the use of a scientific phonetic alphabet,
   when a foreign language is presented for the first time to the
   English beginner in written form, shields him against carrying
   over his native mixed vowel system to languages which use the same
   letters as English, but give quite a different value to them. In
   both cases<sup>1</sup> the essentials of the new instrument of learning
   are the same&mdash;that it be of universal application, that it be
   sufficiently different from the mother-tongue or alphabet to prevent
   confusion by association of ideas, that each of the new forms or
   letters convey only one idea or sound respectively, and that this
   idea or sound be always and only conveyed by that form or letter.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>i.e. scientific regular type grammar and scientific regular
   phonetic alphabet.
</p>

<p>
   (2) From a psychological point of view Esperanto would be a rewarding
   subject of study for children.
</p>

<p>
   The above remarks on sequence of languages show that, by placing
   Esperanto first in the language curriculum, justice is done to
   the psychological maxim: from the easier to the harder, from the
   regular to the exceptional. It may further be argued (<i>a</i>) that
   Esperanto is educative in the real sense of the word, i.e. suitable
   for drawing out and developing the reasoning powers; (<i>b</i>) that
   it would act as a stimulus, and by its ease set a higher standard of
   attainment in language-learning.
</p>

<p>
   (<i>a</i>) Amidst all the discussion of "educationists" about
   methods, curricula, sequence of studies, and the rest, one

<!-- 158.png -->

<a name="page149"> </a><span class = "pagenum">149</span>

   fundamental fact continues to face the teacher when he gets down to
   business; and that is, that he has got to make the taught think for
   themselves. In proportion as his teaching makes them contribute their
   share of effort will it be fruitful. This is, of course, the merest
   truism, sometimes dignified in the current pedagogical slang by the
   name of "self-activity," or the like. But whatever new bottles the
   theorists, and their extreme left wing the faddists, may choose to
   serve up our old wine in, the fact is there: children have got to be
   made to use their own brains. The eternal question that faces the
   teacher is, how to provide problems that children really can work
   out by using their own brains. The trouble about history, geography,
   English literature, and such subjects is that the subject-matter of
   the problems they offer for solution lies beyond the experience of
   the young, and to a large extent beyond their reasoning powers. In
   teaching all such subjects there is accordingly the perpetual danger
   that the real work done may degenerate into mere memory work, or
   parrot-like cramming of notes or dates.
</p>

<p>
   The same difficulty is encountered in science teaching. Heuristic
   methods have been devised to meet the difficulty. Though they are no
   doubt psychologically sound, they tend to be very slow in results;
   hence the common jibe that a boy may learn as much by them in five
   years as he could learn out of a shilling text-book in a term.
</p>

<p>
   The old argument that "mental gymnastics" are best supplied by Latin
   is sound to the extent that Latin really does furnish a perpetual
   series of small problems that have to be solved by the aid of grammar
   and dictionary, but which do involve real mental effort, since
   mere mechanical looking out of words does not suffice for their
   elucidation. But for various reasons, such as the remoteness of the
   ancient world in time, place, modes of thought, etc., Latin tends to
   be too hard and not interesting enough for the average boy. He gets
   discouraged, and develops a habit of only working enough to keep out
   of trouble with the school authorities, and is apt to leave school
   with an unintelligent attitude towards

<!-- 159.png -->

<a name="page150"> </a><span class = "pagenum">150</span>

   intellectual things in general. This is the result of early drudging
   at a subject in which progress is very slow, and which by its nature
   is uncongenial. The great desideratum is a linguistic subject
   which shall at once inculcate a feeling for language (German
   <i>Sprachgef&uuml;hl</i>), and yet be easy enough to admit of rapid
   progress. Nothing keeps alive the quickening zest that makes learning
   fruitful like the consciousness of making rapid progress.
</p>

<p>
   Hitherto arithmetic and Euclid have been the ideal subjects for
   providing the kind of problem required&mdash;one that can be worked
   out with certainty by the aid of rule and use of brain, without
   calling for knowledge or experience that the child cannot have.
   The facts are self-evident, and follow from principles, without
   involving any extraneous acquaintance with life or literature, and no
   deadening memory work is required. If only there were some analogous
   subject on the literary side, to give a general grip of principles,
   uncomplicated by any arbitrary element, what a boon it would be!
   and what a sound preparation for real and more advanced linguistic
   study for those who showed aptitude for this line! Arithmetic and
   Euclid both really depend upon common sense; but partly owing to
   their abstract nature, and partly because they are always classed
   as "mathematics," they seem to contain something repellent to many
   literary or linguistic types of mind.
</p>

<p>
   With the invention of a perfectly regular and logically constructed
   language, a concrete embodiment of the chief principles of language
   structure, we have offered us for the first time the hitherto missing
   linguistic equivalent of arithmetic or Euclid. In a regular language,
   just because everything goes by rule, problems can be set and worked
   out analogous to sums in arithmetic and riders in Euclid. Given
   the necessary roots and rules, the learner can manufacture the
   necessary vocabulary and produce the answer with the same logical
   inevitability; and he has to use his brains to apply his rules,
   instead of merely copying words out of a dictionary, or depending
   upon his memory for them.
</p>

<!-- 160.png -->

<a name="page151"> </a><span class = "pagenum">151</span>

<p>
   In this way all that part of language-study which tends to be dead
   weight in teaching the young is got rid of in one fell swoop, and
   this though the language taught and learnt is a highly developed
   instrument for reading, writing, speaking, and literary expression.
   This dead weight includes most of the unintelligent memorizing, all
   exceptions, all complicated systems of declension and conjugation,
   all irregular comparison of adjectives and adverbs, all syntactical
   subtleties (cf. the sequence of tenses, oratio obliqua, the syntax of
   subordinate clauses, in Latin; and the famous conditional sentences,
   with the no less notorious <i>&omicron;&upsilon;</i> and <i>&mu;&eta;</i>
   in Greek), all conflicting and illogical uses of auxiliaries (cf.
   <i>&ecirc;tre</i> and <i>avoir</i> in French, and <i>sein</i> and
   <i>haben</i> in German), besides a host of other old enemies. Some
   of these things of course are not wholly memory work, especially
   the syntax, which involves a real feeling for language. But these
   would be much better postponed until one easy foreign language has
   been learnt thoroughly. Every multilinguist knows that each foreign
   language is easier to learn than the last. With a perfectly regular
   artificial language you can make so much progress in a short time
   that you can use it freely for practical purposes. Yet it does not
   come of itself, like the mother-tongue. <i>This free manipulation of
   a consciously acquired language is the very best training for forming
   a feeling for language</i>&mdash;far better than weary stumbling over
   the baby stages of a hard language. When you can read, write, and
   speak one very easy artificial language, which you have had to learn
   as a foreign one, then is the time when you can profitably tackle
   the difficulties of natural language, appreciating the niceties of
   syntax, and realizing, by comparison with your normal key-language,
   in what points natural languages are merely arbitrary and have to
   be learnt by heart. Those who have early conquered the grammar and
   syntax of any foreign language, but have had to put in years of
   hard (largely memory) work before they could write or speak, e.g.,
   Latin Latin, French French, or German German, will realize the
   saving effected, when they are told that Esperanto has no idiom, no
   arbitrary usage. The combination of

<!-- 161.png -->

<a name="page152"> </a><span class = "pagenum">152</span>

   words is not governed, as in natural languages, by tradition (which
   tradition has to be assimilated in the sweat of the brow), but
   is free, the only limits being common sense, common grammar, and
   lucidity.
</p>

<p>
   To those who do not know Esperanto it may seem a dark saying that
   language riders can be worked out in the same way as geometrical
   ones. To understand this some knowledge of the language is necessary
   (for sample problems see <a href="#appendixA">Appendix A</a>).
   But for the sake of
   making the argument intelligible it may here be stated that one of
   the labour-saving, vocabulary-saving devices of Esperanto is the
   employment of a number of suffixes with fixed meaning, that can be
   added to any root. Thus:
</p>

<center>
   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Suffixes, one of Esperanto's labour-saving, vocabulary-saving devices.">

      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle" colspan="5">Final <i>-o</i> denotes a noun.</td></tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
   Given this and the root <i>san-</i> (cf. Lat. <i>sanus</i>),
   containing the idea of health, form words for "to heal"
   (<i>san&#8209;ig&#8209;i</i> = to cause to be well); "medicine"
   (<i>san&#8209;ig&#8209;il&#8209;o</i> = instrument of healing); "hospital"
   (<i>san&#8209;ig&#8209;ej&#8209;o</i> = place of healing), etc.
</p>

<p>
   This is merely an example. The combinations and permutations are
   infinite; they give a healthy knowledge of word-building, and can be
   used in putting whole pages of carefully prepared idiomatic English
   into Esperanto. Practical experience shows that, given the necessary
   crude roots, the necessary suffixes, and a one-page grammar of the
   Esperanto language, an intelligent person can produce in Esperanto a
   translation of a page of idiomatic English, not Ollendorfian phrases,
   <i>without having learnt Esperanto</i>.
</p>

<p>
   (<i>b</i>) Experience also shows that the intelligent one thoroughly
   enjoys himself while doing so; and having done so, experiences a
   thrill of exhilaration almost amounting to awe at having made a
   better translation into a language he has never learnt than he could
   make into a national language that he has learnt for years, e.g.
   Latin, French, or German.
</p>

<!-- 162.png -->

<a name="page153"> </a><span class = "pagenum">153</span>

<p>
   And what is exhilaration in the dry tree may be sustained working
   keenness in the green. The stimulus to the young mind of progress
   swift and sure is immense. A child who has learnt to read, write,
   and speak Esperanto in six months, as is very possible within the
   natural limits of power of expression imposed by his age, not only
   has a sound working knowledge of grammatical categories and forms,
   which will stand him in good stead in subsequent language-learning;
   he has also a quite different attitude of mind&mdash;<i>une tout autre
   mentalit&eacute;</i>, to use recent jargon&mdash;towards foreign
   languages. His only experience of learning one has been that he did
   so with the object and result of being able to read, write, and
   speak it within a reasonable time. "By so much the greater and more
   resounding the slump into actuality," you will say, "when he comes to
   grapple with his next." Perhaps. But even so, the habit of acquiring
   fresh words and forms for immediate use must surely tell&mdash;not to
   mention that he will incidentally have acquired a very useful Romance
   vocabulary, and a wholly admirable French lucidity of construction.
</p>

<p>
   (3) And this question of lucidity brings us to the third great
   educational advantage of Esperanto. Its opponents&mdash;without having
   ever learnt it to see&mdash;have urged that its preciseness will
   debauch the literary sense. Surely the exact opposite is the fact.
   <i>Le style c'est l'homme</i>, and the essence of true style is that
   a man should give accurate expression to his thoughts. The French
   wit, satirizing vapid fine writing, said that language was given to
   man to enable him to conceal his thought. There is no more potent
   instrument for obscuring or concealing thought than the ready-made
   phrase. Take up many a piece of journalese or other slipshod writing,
   and note how often the conventional phrase or word slips from under
   the pen, meaning nothing in particular. The very conventionality
   disguises from writer and reader the confusion or absolute lack of
   idea it serves to cloak. Both are lulled by the familiar sound of
   the set phrase or word and glide easily over them. On the other
   hand, in using a language in which you construct a good deal of your
   vocabulary

<!-- 163.png -->

<a name="page154"> </a><span class = "pagenum">154</span>

   according to logical rule <i>tout en marchant</i>, it is impossible
   to avoid thinking, at each moment, exactly what you do mean. Where
   there is no idiom, no arbitrary usage, no ready-made phrase, there is
   also far less danger of yielding to a fatal facility.
</p>

<p>
   Take an instance or two. In the Prayer Book occurs the phrase
   "Fulfil, O Lord, our desires and petitions." At Sunday lunch a mixed
   party of people, after attending morning service, were asked how
   they would render into Esperanto the word "desires." They nearly
   all plumped for <i>dezira&#309;o</i>. Now, the Esperanto root for
   "desire" is <i>dezir-</i>. By adding <i>-o</i> it becomes a noun =
   the act of desiring, a desire. By adding the suffix <i>-a&#309;</i>,
   and then <i>-o</i>, it becomes concrete = a desire- (i.e. desired)
   thing, a desire. A reference to the dictionary showed that the
   English word "desire" has both these meanings, but none of these
   people had a sufficiently accurate idea of the use of language to
   realize this. It was only when a gentleman passed his plate for
   a second helping of beef, and was asked which he expected to be
   fulfilled&mdash;the beef, or his aspiration for beef&mdash;that he,
   under the stimulus of hunger, adopted the rendering <i>dezir&#8209;o</i>,
   thereby saving at once his bacon and his additional beef.
</p>

<p>
   It is not of course necessary for people to define pedantically
   to themselves the meaning of every word they use, but surely it
   must conduce to clear thinking to use a language in which you are
   perpetually called upon, if you are writing seriously, to make just
   the mental effort necessary to think what you do mean.
</p>

<p>
   Again, consider the use of prepositions. This is, in nearly all
   national languages, extremely fluctuating and arbitrary. Take a few
   English phrases showing the use of the prepositions "at" and "with."
   "At seven o'clock"; "at any price"; "at all times"; "at the worst";
   "let it go at that"; "I should say at a guess," etc. "Come with me";
   "write with a pen"; "he came with a rush"; "things are different
   with us"; "with a twinkle in his eye"; "with God all things are
   possible," etc. Try to turn these phrases into any language you think
   you know; the odds are that you will find yourself "up against it
   pretty badly." The fact is, that

<!-- 164.png -->

<a name="page155"> </a><span class = "pagenum">155</span>

   prepositions are very frequently used on no logical plan, not at all
   according to any fixed or universal meaning; all that can be said
   about them in a given phrase is that they are used there because
   they are used. To remember their equivalents in other languages hard
   memory work and much phrase-learning is necessary. In Esperanto all
   that is necessary is: first, to become clear as to the exact meaning;
   secondly, to pick the preposition that conveys it. There is no doubt,
   as the Esperanto prepositions are fixed in sense, on the "one word
   one meaning" plan. The point is, that there is no memory searching,
   often so utterly vain, for there are few people indeed who can write
   a few pages of the most familiar foreign languages without getting
   their prepositions all wrong, and having "foreigner" stamped large
   all across their efforts. In Esperanto, provided you have a clear
   mind and know your grammar, <i>you are right</i>. No arbitrary usage
   defeats your efforts and makes discouraging jargon of your literary
   attempts.
</p>

<p>
   This training in clear thought, the first requisite for all good
   writing, is surely sound practical pedagogics. By the time you can
   give up conscious word-building in Esperanto, and use words and
   phrases by rote, you have done enough bracing thinking to teach you
   caution in the use of the ready-made phrase and horror of the vague
   word.
</p>

<p>
   Fools make phrases, and wise men shun them. Here is a phrase-free
   language: need we shun it?

   The following tables are meant to give some idea of the number
   and variety of different ideas that can be expressed by a single
   Esperanto root, with the addition of affixes (prefixes and suffixes).
   By reading the English, French, and German columns downwards, the
   reader will see how many different roots and periphrases these
   languages employ in order to express the same ideas.
</p>

<p>
   As the affixes have fixed meanings, they only have to be learnt
   once for all, and many of them (e.g. <i>-ist</i>, <i>-in</i>,
   <i>re-</i>) are already familiar. When once acquired, they can be
   used in unending permutation and combination with different roots
   and each other. The tables below are by no means exhaustive of
   what can be done with the roots <i>san-</i> and <i>lern-</i>. They
   are merely illustrative. By referring to the full
   <a href="#partIVchapterIV">table of affixes</a>
   the reader can
   go on forming new compounds <i>ad libitum</i>: e.g. san&#8209;o,
   san&#8209;a, san&#8209;e, san&#8209;i, saneco, sanilo, sanulo,
   malsane, malsani, saneti, malsaneti, sanadi, eksani, eksani&#285;i,
   saninda, sanindi, sanindulo, sana&#309;o, sana&#309;ero, sanilo,

<p>
   The following table
   illustrates the perfect simplicity and terseness of the Esperanto
   verb.
</p>

<p>
   Every tense, active and passive, is formed with never more than
   two words. Every shade of meaning (continued, potential, etc.,
   action) is expressed by these two words, of which one is the single
   auxiliary <i>esti</i> (itself conjugated regularly). The double
   auxiliary&mdash;"to be" and "to have"&mdash;which infests most modern
   languages, with all its train of confusing and often illogical
   distinctions (cf. French <i>je suis all&eacute;</i>, but <i>j'ai
   couru</i>), disappears. Contrast the simplicity of <i>amota</i>
   with the cumbersome periphrasis <i>about to be loved</i>; or the
   perfect ease and clearness of <i>vi estus amita</i> with the
   treble-barrelled German <i>Sie w&uuml;rden geliebt worden
   sein</i>.
</p>

<p>
   This simplicity of the Esperanto verb is entirely due to its full
   participial system. There are six participles, present, past, and
   future active and passive, each complete in one word. The

   only natural Aryan language (of those commonly studied) that compares
   with Esperanto in this respect is Greek; and it is precisely the
   fulness of the Greek participial system that lends to the language
   a great part of that flexibility which all ages have agreed in
   admiring in it pre-eminently. Take a page of Plato or any other
   Greek author, and count the number of participles and note their
   use. They will be found more numerous and more delicately effective
   than in other languages. Esperanto can do all this; and it can do
   it without any of the complexity of form and irregularity that
   makes the learning of Greek verbs such a hard task. Bearing in mind
   the three characteristic vowels of the three tenses&mdash;present
   <i>-a</i>, past <i>-i</i>, future <i>-o</i> (common to finite tenses
   and participles)&mdash;the proverbial schoolboy, and the dullest at
   that, could hardly make the learning of the Esperanto participles
   last him half an hour.
</p>

<p>
   It would be easy to go on filling page after page with the
   simplifications effected by Esperanto, but these will not fail to
   strike the learner after a very brief acquaintance with the language.
   But attention ought to be drawn to one more particularly clever
   device&mdash;the form of asking questions. An Esperanto statement
   is converted into a question without any inversion of subject and
   verb or any change at all, except the addition of the interrogative
   particle <i>&#265;u</i>. In this Esperanto agrees with Japanese.
   But whereas Japanese adds its particle <i>ka</i> at the end of the
   sentence, the Esperanto <i>&#265;u</i> stands first in its clause.
   Thus when, speaking Esperanto, you wish to ask a question, you begin
   by shouting out <i>&#265;u</i>, an admirably distinctive monosyllable
   which cannot be confused with any other word in the language. By this
   means you get your interlocutor prepared and attending, and you can
   then frame your question at leisure.
</p>

<p>
   Contrast Esperanto and English in the ease with which they
   respectively convert a statement into a question.
</p>

<p class="dekstre">
   English : You went&mdash;did you go?<br/>
   Esperanto : Vi iris&mdash;&#265;u vi iris?
</p>

<!-- 170.png -->

<a name="page161"> </a><span class = "pagenum">161</span>

<p>
   This particle may be considered the equivalent of the initial mark of
   interrogation used in Spanish, and serves to remove all complications
   in connexion with word order.

   This chapter on labour-saving may fitly conclude with an estimate
   of the amount of mere memorizing work to be done in Esperanto.
   Since this is almost <i>nil</i> for grammar, syntax, and idiom, and
   since there are no irregularities or exceptions, the memory work
   is, broadly speaking, reduced to learning the affixes, the table
   of correlatives, and a certain number of new roots. This number is
   astonishingly small. Here is an estimate made by Prof. Macloskie, of
   Princeton, U.S.A.:

   Technically speaking, Esperanto combines the characteristics of
   an inflected language with those of an agglutinative one. This
   means that the syllables used as inflexions (<i>-o</i>, <i>-a</i>,
   <i>-e</i>, <i>-as</i>, <i>-is</i>, <i>-os</i>, <i>-ant-</i>,
   <i>-int-</i>, <i>-ont-</i>, etc.), being invariable and of universal
   application, can also be regarded as separate words. And as separate
   words they all figure in the dictionary, under their initial letters.
   Thus anything written in Esperanto can be deciphered by the simple
   process of looking out words and parts of words in the dictionary.
   For examples, see pieces 1 and 2 in the
   <a href="#partIVchapterII">specimens of Esperanto</a>,
   and read the Note at the beginning of
   <a href="#partIV">Part&nbsp;IV</a>.
   As the Esperanto dictionary only consists

<!-- 171.png -->

<a name="page162"> </a><span class = "pagenum">162</span>

   of a few pages, it can be easily carried in the pocket-book or
   waistcoat pocket.
</p>

<p>
   Thus, while to the educated person of Aryan speech Esperanto presents
   the natural appearance of an ordinary inflected language, one who
   belongs by speech to another lingual family, or any one who has never
   heard of Esperanto, can regard every inflected word as a compound of
   invariable elements. By turning over very few pages he can determine
   the meaning and use of each element, and therefore, by putting them
   together, he can arrive at the sense of the compound word, e.g.
   <i>lav'ist'in'o</i>. Look out <i>lav-</i>, and you find "wash"; look
   out <i>-ist</i>, and you find it expresses the person who does an
   action; look out <i>-in</i>, and you find it expresses the feminine;
   look out <i>-o</i>, and you find it denotes a noun. Put the whole
   together, and you get "female who does washing, laundress."
</p>

<p>
   Suppose you are going on an ocean voyage, and you expect to be
   shut up for weeks in a ship with persons of many nationalities.
   You take with you keys to Esperanto, price one halfpenny each, in
   various languages. You wish to tackle a Russian. Write your Esperanto
   sentence clearly and put the paper in his hand. At the same time hand
   him a Russian key to Esperanto, pointing to the following paragraph
   (in Russian) on the outside:
</p>

<p>
   "Everything written in the international language can be translated
   by the help of this vocabulary. If several words together express
   but a single idea, they are written in one word, but separated by
   apostrophes; e.g. <i>frat'in'o</i>, though a single idea, is yet
   composed of three words, which must be looked for separately in the
   vocabulary."
</p>

<p>
   After he has got over his shock of surprise, your Russian, if a man
   of ordinary education, will make out your sentence in a very short
   time by using the key.
</p>

<p>
   As an example Dr. Zamenhof gives the following sentence: "Mi
   ne sci'as kie mi las'is la baston'o'n: &#264;u vi &#285;i'n ne
   vid'is?"<br/>
   With the vocabulary this sentence will work out as follows:

   <div class="subtitolo">
      SPECIMENS OF ESPERANTO, WITH GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY
   </div>
</div>

<p align="center" class="majusklete">Note</p>

<p>
   The best way of learning Esperanto is to begin at once to read the
   language. Do not trouble to learn the grammar and list of suffixes by
   themselves first. All this can be picked up easily in the course of
   reading.
</p>

<p>
   In the following specimens the first two pieces are marked for
   beginners. Each part of a word marked off by hyphens is to be looked
   out separately in the vocabulary. By the time the beginner has read
   these two pieces carefully in this way he will know the grammar, and
   have a fair idea of the structure of the language and the use of
   affixes.
</p>

<p>
   In order to save time in looking out words, and so quicken the
   process of learning, the English translation of the third piece is
   given in parallel columns. Therefore in this piece only the principal
   words, which might be unfamiliar to English readers, are given in the
   vocabulary. Word-formation and some points of grammar are explained
   in the notes.
</p>

<p>
   To get a practical grasp of Esperanto, cover the left-hand
   (Esperanto) column with a piece of paper after reading it, and
   re-translate the English into Esperanto, using the notes. After half
   an hour per day of such exercise for two or three weeks, an ordinary
   educated person will know Esperanto pretty well.
</p>

<p>
   N.B.&mdash;It is very important to acquire a correct pronunciation at
   the start. Study the pronunciation rules, and practise reading aloud
   before beginning to translate. <i>Read slowly.</i>

   <i>Vowels</i>

<p>
   There are no long and short, open and closed, vowels: just five
   simple, full-sounding vowels, always pronounced the same. English
   people must be particularly careful to make them sufficiently full.

   a prefix denoting the opposite. <sup>3</sup>Unknown. To know =
   <i>koni</i>. Pres. part. pass. <i>-at-</i> Negative = <i>ne</i>.
   (<i>bona</i> = good; <i>malbona</i> = bad; <i>nebona</i> = not
   good.) <sup>4</sup>Plain. Flat = <i>eben&#8209;a</i>. <i>a&#309;</i>

   of. <sup>5</sup>Outer. Outside (preposition) = <i>ekster</i>.
   <i>a</i> denotes an adjective. <sup>6</sup>Towards one side. Side
   = <i>flank&#8209;o</i>. <i>e</i> denotes an adverb; <i>flanke</i>
   = "sidely," i.e. at the side, <i>n</i> denotes motion towards.
   <sup>7</sup>Journeying. This participial phrase qualifies the verb,
   <i>venus</i>, like an adverb. In Esperanto the participle therefore
   takes an <i>e</i> which denotes an adverb. <sup>8</sup>Ten days,
   i.e. for the duration of ten days. Duration of time is put in the
   accusative case. <sup>9</sup>Big mountain-range. Mountain

         Nu okazis ke certa knabo, pensema preter siaj jaroj, komencis
         pripensi tiun &#265;i mizeran staton. Li vivis kun sia vidvina
         patrino, kiu havis du infanetojn krom Namezo (tiel nomi&#285;is
         la knabo). Ili estis tre malri&#265;aj, kaj devis sen&#265;ese
         labori por nutri sin mem kaj la infanojn. La vidvino ne havis
         pli ol kvardek jarojn, sed Namezo rimarkis ke vespere, post
         la taga laboro, &#349;i &#349;ajnis tute lacega, kaj kelkajn
         jarojn post la morto de sia edzo &#349;i ekmaljuni&#285;is.

         la okulojn ekster sia hejmo kaj rigardis &#265;irka&#365;en.
         Li vidis ke &#265;iuflanke estis tiel same: la geviroj frue
         maljuni&#285;is kaj multe suferis. Li pensis, "Balda&#365;

         Now, it happened that a certain boy, thoughtful<sup>1</sup>
         beyond his years, began to think over this wretched state of
         things. He lived with his<sup>2</sup> widowed mother, who
         had two little children besides Namezo (this was the lad's
         name<sup>3</sup>). They were very poor, and were obliged to
         work hard without stopping to get food for themselves and
         the children. The widow was not more than forty, but Namezo
         noticed that of an evening, after the day's work, she seemed
         quite tired out,<sup>4</sup> and a few years<sup>5</sup> after
         her husband's death she grew old all at once.<sup>6</sup>
         Often the boy told her she ought to take more rest, but every
         morning<sup>7</sup> she had the same worn-out look as in the
         evening; and she complained that the winds blowing through of a
         night plagued<sup>8</sup> her with<sup>9</sup> rheumatic pains,
         and in summer she could not sleep because of the heat. Then the
         boy turned his eyes outwards from his home and looked around
         him. He saw that on every side it was the same<sup>10</sup>:
         men and women<sup>11</sup> grew old early and suffered much. He
         thought, "Soon it will be the same with me; youth<sup>12</sup>
         is short and full of work, and life is long and full of
         trouble." At last he became gloomy altogether.<sup>13</sup>

         When he came to the foot<sup>3</sup> of the mountains, the

         Namezo had been greatly mistaken<sup>5</sup> in the distance.
         He had never seen a mountain before, and so, when he caught
         sight of the peak half-way, he thought he was just getting
         there, and walked slower. For three days he thought every
         morning, "I shall be at the foot of the mountains this evening;
         to-morrow I'll climb<sup>6</sup> to the top." But now he
         knew that he was late.<sup>7</sup> He had already eaten up
         half<sup>8</sup> of his provisions,<sup>9</sup> and for the
         last few miles he was beginning to see that his peak was part
         of a boundless mountain-range, that it was still far off and
         he would by no means get up so easily. He calculated that at
         least eight days' food would be needed to get home from the
         foot of the mountain-range, and he buried<sup>10</sup> that
         amount<sup>11</sup> there for the return journey. Thus only
         two days' provision was left for the ascent and descent of the
         mountain.

         it from the neighbours when it began to grow up. And he went
         out of the village by night, and planted it far away from all
         the houses, by a little stream in a hollow<sup>1</sup> of the
         ground, where it would not be seen till it grew very big. And
         at first he went there only by night; but, as he said no more
         about his seed, the villagers forgot the matter, so that he
         could go out of the village in the evenings after his day's
         work whenever he liked, and nobody troubled about where he was
         going.<sup>2</sup> But he did not dare to transplant it to
         his own cottage, fearing that they would damage it in jest or
         malice, and so the hard work remained for him of going a long
         way to look after it, when he was already tired.

         seeing that in spite of all the little tree did not flourish,
         he prepared<sup>5</sup> a new soil-bed and transplanted
         it, having first ploughed in a different kind of earth. He

         And to these Namezo answered nothing. He knew that he had
         given a great part of his life to making experiment and had
         produced a well-grown tree, while the clever men were now
         seeing a tree for the first time, and were wholly ignorant of
         the difficulties that had to be overcome, and did not even
         understand the question they were undertaking to solve. But he
         also knew that to clever men such a consideration is less than
         nothing. It was no good to argue with them, for they did not
         know that they did not know, and this is the hardest thing to
         learn. So he let them keep on talking, and tended his tree as
         before. "For," said he to himself, "when the tree has spread
         and multiplied after its kind throughout the land, from many
         men's gradual experience there will arise a science of trees,
         and thus we shall in the end find out the best way of tending
         them." Also he thought, "The devil was right: the devil is a
         clever man."

   8. The verb has no separate ending for person or number.
</p>

   The present ends in <i>-as</i>. Ex. <i>mi amas</i> = I love.
</p>

   The imperative ends in <i>-u</i>. Ex. <i>amu</i> = love! <i>ni

   <i>Dio ordonas ke ni amu unu la alian</i> = God commands us to love
   one another.

   There are three active participles.
</p>

<p>
   The present participle active is formed by <i>-ant</i>. Ex.
   <i>amanta</i> = loving; <i>amanto</i> = a lover.
</p>

<p>
   The past participle active is formed by <i>-int</i>. Ex.
   <i>aminta</i> = having loved; <i>la skribinto</i> = the author (lit.
   the man who has written).
</p>

<p>
   The future participle active is formed by <i>-ont</i>. Ex.
   <i>amonta</i> = being about to love.
</p>

<p>
   There are three passive participles.
</p>

<p>
   The present participle passive is formed by <i>-at</i>. Ex.

</p>

<p>
   The past participle passive is formed by <i>-it</i>. Ex. <i>amita</i>
   = having been loved.
</p>

<p>
   The future participle passive is formed by <i>-ot</i>. Ex.
   <i>amota</i> = being about to be loved.
</p>

<p>
   All compound tenses, as well as the passive voice, are formed by
   the verb <i>esti</i> (to be) with a participle. Compound tenses are
   employed only when the simple forms are inadequate. Ex. <i>mi estas
   aminta</i> = I have loved (lit. I am having loved); <i>vi estis
   aminta</i> = you had loved (lit. you were having loved); <i>ili
   estas amataj</i> = they are loved; <i>&#349;i estas amita</i> = she has
   been loved; <i>ni estis amitaj</i> = we had been loved; <i>ili estos
   amintaj</i> = they will have loved; <i>&#349;i estus aminta</i> = she
   would have loved; <i>mi estus amita</i> = I should have been loved.

   *<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;<i>Tiu</i>, <i>kiu</i>, etc., are used in
   agreement with a noun expressed, even when it does not represent a

   <i>Tiuj &#265;i floroj</i> = these flowers.

<div class="aldonotitolo" id="appendixA">
   APPENDIX A
   <div class="subtitolo">
      sample problems in regular language
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   Word-building can be made quite an amusing game for children.
   For instance, give them the suffixes <i>-ej</i> (denoting place)
   and <i>-il</i> (denoting instrument), and set them to form words
   for "school," "church," "factory," "knife," "warming-pan,"
   etc. (<i>lernejo</i>, <i>pre&#285;ejo</i>, <i>fabrikejo</i>,
   <i>tran&#265;ito</i>, <i>varmigilo</i>).
</p>

<p>
   But since the language is perfectly regular in form and construction,
   and the learner can therefore argue from case to case, it is a useful
   instrument for instilling clear ideas of grammatical categories. Thus
   give the roots&mdash;
</p>

<center>
   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" summary="Sample problems.">
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>viv&#8209;i</i> = to live</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>san&#8209;a</i> = healthy</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>hom&#8209;o</i> = man</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>long&#8209;a</i> = long</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>sa&#285;-a</i> = wise</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>Di&#8209;o</i> = God</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>don&#8209;i</i> = to give</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">&nbsp;</td></tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
   and set such sentences as the following to be worked out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
   "He lives long"; "A long life is a gift of God"; "It is wise to live
   healthily"; "God is divine, man is human"; "Human life is short,"
   etc.
</p>

<p>
   The same roots constantly recur with an <i>-o</i>, <i>-a</i>, or
   <i>-e</i> tacked on; and the practice in sorting out the endings, and
   attaching them like labels to nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs,
   soon marks off the corresponding ideas clearly in the learner's mind.
</p>

<p>
   Analogous to simple sums and conducive to clear thinking are such
   sentences as the following, for rather more advanced pupils:
</p>

<p>
   Given&mdash;
</p>

<center>
   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" summary="Sample problems.">
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>raz&#8209;i</i> = to shave</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>serv&#8209;i</i> = to serve</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>san&#8209;a</i> = healthy</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>akr&#8209;a</i> = sharp</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>mort&#8209;i</i> = to die</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>ven&#8209;i</i> = to come</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>uz&#8209;i</i> = to use</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>hak&#8209;i</i> = to hew</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>kun</i> = with</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle"><i>sent&#8209;i</i> = to feel</td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap" align="left" valign="middle">&nbsp;</td></tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
   and the <a href="#partIVchapterIV">table of affixes</a>.
</p>

<!-- 210.png -->

<a name="page201"> </a><span class = "pagenum">201</span>

<p>
   Translate&mdash;"Constant use had blunted his razor"; "He had his
   servant shaved"; "He killed his companion with an axe"; "Let us send
   for the doctor."
</p>

<p>
   More advanced exercise (on the same roots):
</p>

<p>
   Translate&mdash;"O Death, where is thy sting?" "Community of service
   brings together men subject to death, and dulls the perception of
   their common mortality. Willing service dissipates the weariness of
   the server; the deadliness of disease is mitigated, and the place of
   sickness becomes a place of health."
</p>

<p>
   By referring to the table of affixes, the use of which has of course
   been explained, the learner can work out the answers as follows:
</p>

<p>
   Uz&#8209;ad&#8209;o estis mal&#8209;akr&#8209;ig&#8209;int&#8209;a lian raz&#8209;il&#8209;on. Li raz&#8209;ig&#8209;is sian
   serv&#8209;ant-(<i>or</i> ist)on. Li mort&#8209;ig&#8209;is sian kun&#8209;ul&#8209;on per
   hak&#8209;il&#8209;o. Ni ven&#8209;ig&#8209;u la san&#8209;ig&#8209;ist&#8209;on.
</p>

<p>
   More advanced:
</p>

<p>
   Ho Morto, kie estas via akr&#8209;ec&#8209;o? Kun&#8209;servo (<i>or</i> kuneco de
   servo) kun&#8209;ig&#8209;as la mort&#8209;em-(ul)-ojn, kaj mal&#8209;akr&#8209;ig&#8209;as la sent&#8209;on de
   ilia kun&#8209;a mort&#8209;em&#8209;ec&#8209;o. Serv&#8209;em&#8209;ec&#8209;o dis&#8209;ig&#8209;as la el&#8209;uz&#8209;it&#8209;ec&#8209;on de
   la serv&#8209;ant&#8209;o; la mort&#8209;ig&#8209;ec&#8209;o de la mal&#8209;san&#8209;ec&#8209;o mal&#8209;akr&#8209;i&#285;-as,
   kaj la mal&#8209;san&#8209;ej&#8209;o i&#285;as san&#8209;ej&#8209;o.
</p>

<p>
   No national language could be used in this way for building sentences
   according to rules, and such exercises should give a practical grip
   of clear use of language. The student is obliged to analyse the exact
   meaning of every word of the English sentence, and this necessity
   inculcates a nice discrimination in the use of words. At the same
   time the necessary word-building depends upon clear-headed and
   logical application of rule. There is no memory work, but the mind
   is kept on the stretch, and the exercise is wholesome as combating
   confusion of thought and slovenliness of expression.

   APPENDIX C
   <div class="subtitolo">
      the letter <i>c</i> in esperanto
   </div>
</div>

<p>
   <i>c</i> = <i>ts</i> in English "bits."
</p>

<p>
   This has given rise to much criticism. The same sound is also
   expressed by the letters <i>ts</i>. Why depart from the Esperanto
   principle, "one sound, one letter," and have two symbols (<i>c</i>
   and <i>ts</i>) for the same sound?
</p>

<p>
   A standing difficulty of an international language is: What
   equivalent shall be adopted for the <i>c</i> of national languages?
   The difficulty arises owing to the diversity of value and history of
   the <i>c</i> in diverse tongues. Philologists, who know the history
   of the Latin hard <i>c</i> and its various descendants in modern
   languages, will appreciate this.
</p>

<p>
   (1) Shall <i>c</i> be adopted in the international language, or
   omitted? If it is omitted, many useful words, which it is desirable
   to adopt and which are ordinarily spelt with a <i>c</i>, will
   have to be arbitrarily deformed, and this deformation may amount
   to actual obscuring of their sense. E.g. <i>cento</i> = hundred;
   <i>centro</i> = centre; <i>cerbo</i> = brain; <i>certa</i> = certain;
   <i>cirkonstanco</i> = circumstance; <i>civila</i> = civil, etc.
   Such works would become almost unrecognizable for many in the forms
   <i>kento</i>, <i>sento</i>, <i>tsento</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>
   (2) If, then, <i>c</i> is retained, what value is to be given to
   it? The hard and soft sounds of the English <i>c</i> (as in English
   "cat," "civil") are already represented by <i>k</i> and <i>s</i>.
   Neither of these letters can be dispensed with in the international
   language; and it is undesirable to confuse orthographically or
   phonetically <i>c</i>-roots with <i>s</i>- or <i>k</i>-roots.
   Therefore another value must be found for the symbol <i>c</i>. The
   choice is practically narrowed down to the Italian soft <i>c</i>
   = <i>ch</i>, as in English "church," and the German<sup>1</sup> <i>c</i>
   = <i>ts</i> in English "bits." Now <i>ch</i> is a useful and
   distinctive sound, and has been adopted in Esperanto with a symbol of
   its own: &#265;. Therefore <i>ts</i> remains.
</p>

<p class="piednoto">
   <sup>1</sup>Also late Latin and early Norman French.
</p>

<!-- 214.png -->

<a name="page205"> </a><span class = "pagenum">205</span>

<p>
   (3) Why not then abolish <i>c</i> and write <i>ts</i> instead? For
   answer, see No. (1) above. It is a worse evil to introduce such
   monstrosities as <i>tsento</i>, <i>tsivila</i>, etc., than to allow
   two symbols for the same sound, <i>ts</i> and <i>c</i>. International
   language has to appeal to the eye as well as to the ear.
</p>

<p>
   This matter of the <i>c</i> is only one more instance of the wisdom
   of Dr. Zamenhof in refusing to make a fetish of slavish adherence
   to rule. Practical common-sense is a safer guide than theory in
   attaining the desired goal&mdash;ease (of eye, ear, tongue, and pen)
   for greatest number. In practice no confusion arises between <i>c</i>
   and <i>ts</i>.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
